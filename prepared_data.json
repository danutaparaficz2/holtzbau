This study integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology, Machine Learning (ML)\nmodels, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to enhance\nwater quality monitoring and prediction in aquaculture. IoT sensors continuously mea-\nsured parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and turbidity, while\nML models—including Random Forest—provided high accuracy predictions (R2 = 0.999,\nRMSE = 0.0998 mg/L). The integration of the QAOA reduced model training time by 50%,\nenabling rapid, real-time responses to changing water conditions. Over 6000 corrective\ninterventions were conducted during the study, maintaining fish survival rates above\n90% in tropical aquaculture environments. This adaptable system is designed for both\nurban and rural settings, using low-cost sensors and local data processing for constrained\nenvironments or cloud-based systems for real-time analysis. The results demonstrate the\npotential of IoT–ML–QAOA integration to mitigate environmental risks, optimize fish\nhealth, and support sustainable aquaculture practices. By addressing technological and\ninfrastructural constraints, this study advances aquaculture management and contributes\nto global food security.\nKeywords: aquaculture; Internet of Things; machine learning; quantum optimization; water\nquality; random forest; support vector machines; real-time monitoring; RRMSE; RRMSPE\n1. Introduction\nAquaculture has become a cornerstone in global food production, providing over\nhalf of the fish consumed worldwide as of 2020, according to the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO) of the United Nations. Despite its significant role in ensuring food\nsecurity, aquaculture faces ongoing challenges, particularly in managing water quality—an\nessential factor in maintaining healthy fish stocks and sustainable production. Variations\nin water parameters, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and turbidity, are\nknown to impact fish health and growth rates, often resulting in substantial economic losses.\nWater 2025, 17, 82\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/w17010082\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n2 of 25\nStudies indicate that low DO levels can reduce fish growth by up to 40% in poorly managed\nponds, underscoring the need for more efficient, data-driven management solutions in\naquaculture, especially in rural regions with limited technological resources [1].\nThe current research landscape highlights promising advancements in aquaculture\nthrough emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning\n(ML). The IoT enables the continuous collection of critical water data through networks of\nsensors, providing valuable, timely insights into conditions that may affect fish populations.\nConcurrently, ML algorithms, including Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines\n(SVMs), have demonstrated utility in predictive analytics, allowing aquaculture managers\nto anticipate and mitigate critical shifts in water quality. Combining the IoT with ML\nhas shown potential, with studies reporting up to a 30% reduction in losses due to water\nquality issues [2,3]. However, existing systems often face limitations, such as a reliance on\nstatic or semi-real-time monitoring and inefficiencies in handling computational demands,\nparticularly in resource-limited settings [4].\nTo address these challenges, this study integrates quantum optimization, specifically\nthe Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), with IoT–ML systems to\nenhance predictive efficiency and reduce processing times. Unlike traditional systems, the\nQAOA accelerates the processing of ML models by up to 50%, enabling rapid responses to\nwater quality fluctuations [5]. This capability is crucial in tropical aquaculture environments\nlike those in Montería, Colombia, where environmental changes can occur suddenly and\nrequire immediate interventions. By combining the IoT, ML, and the QAOA, the proposed\nsystem offers a novel, scalable framework for real-time water quality management that is\nadaptable to both high-tech urban and resource-constrained rural environments.\nThis research aims to address two critical questions: How can IoT–ML systems be\noptimized and adapted for aquaculture in rural, resource-constrained areas? And, to what\nextent can quantum optimization improve predictive model processing times, especially\nin scenarios requiring rapid responses to changing water conditions? By exploring these\nquestions, the study advances the field of aquaculture by demonstrating a novel application\nof quantum technologies in real-time environmental monitoring and predictive analytics.\nThe main objective of this paper is to present an integrative approach to enhancing\nwater quality monitoring in aquaculture by combining the IoT, ML, and the QAOA for ef-\nfective, real-time responses to changing conditions. The system’s performance is rigorously\nevaluated using advanced metrics, including Root Relative Mean Squared Prediction Error\n(RRMSPE) and Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) [6]. These evaluations provide\ninsights into model accuracy and stability, essential for IoT applications in aquaculture. The\nfindings demonstrate that integrating the IoT, ML, and quantum optimization can improve\nfish health, reduce mortality rates, and support the broader scientific understanding of\nsustainable aquaculture management systems.\n2. Literature Review\nThe adoption of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine\nLearning (ML), and quantum algorithms has shown significant potential for improving\nwater quality management in aquaculture systems. These innovations have gained in-\ncreased attention in the recent scientific literature due to their capacity to optimize real-time\nmonitoring and enhance operational efficiency in aquaculture production. For example,\nrecent studies document how the IoT and ML facilitate real-time data collection, allowing\nfor the precise prediction of critical water quality variables such as dissolved oxygen and\npH, which are crucial for fish welfare [4,5]. However, despite the promising nature of these\nadvancements, significant challenges remain, especially in the full integration and scala-\nbility of these technologies in rural regions where technological resources are limited [7].\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n3 of 25\nThese limitations underscore the need for more robust and accessible solutions to manage\nwater quality effectively, a point that several studies have emphasized as essential for the\nlong-term sustainability of aquaculture [8].\nTo address these challenges, a systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA\nmethodology (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses),\nwhich included studies published between 2018 and 2024 [9–12]. This review identified\nboth advancements in the implementation of technologies such as the IoT, ML, and quantum\nalgorithms in aquaculture, as well as the gaps that still need to be resolved to ensure a wider\nadoption of these tools. The results suggest that the incorporation of quantum algorithms\nis particularly promising for managing large volumes of real-time data, especially in\naquaculture systems where rapid response capability is crucial for maintaining water\nquality and fish welfare [13].\nThe study search was conducted in high-impact academic databases such as IEEE\nXplore, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, using an optimized search string: (“IoT” OR\n“Internet of Things”) AND (“Machine Learning” OR “ML”) AND (“Water Quality” OR\n“Water Monitoring”) AND (“Aquaculture” OR “Fish Farming”). This strategy enabled\nthe identification of 86 studies addressing the use of these technologies for water quality\nmanagement in aquaculture. The flexibility in the search string and the use of multiple\nacademic databases contributed to obtaining a broad range of relevant studies.\nInclusion Criteria:\n•\nArticles published between 2018 and 2024.\n•\nPeer-reviewed studies analyzing the use of the IoT, ML, or quantum algorithms in\nwater quality management in aquaculture.\n•\nPapers with verifiable DOIs that include quantitative data or predictive models.\nExclusion Criteria:\n•\nNon-peer-reviewed studies or those without a valid DOI.\n•\nPublications that do not include specific applications in aquaculture.\n•\nArticles focusing solely on treatment technologies without the integration of the IoT\nor ML.\nStudy Selection Process:\n1.\nIdentification: Initially, 86 studies were identified using the applied search string.\n2.\nScreening: After removing duplicates and irrelevant articles (those that did not specif-\nically address the IoT, ML, or aquaculture topics), 65 studies remained for further\nevaluation.\n3.\nEligibility: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25 studies were selected\nas they met the relevancy and quality requirements.\n4.\nInclusion: Finally, 13 key studies were selected based on their detailed use of the IoT,\nML, and quantum algorithms for water quality management in aquaculture systems,\nfocusing on their practical application, innovation, and scalability, fulfilling all the\nmethodological requirements.\nTable 1 presents a summary of the findings from the selected studies, highlighting the\nmain deficiencies identified and areas for improvement regarding the implementation of\nemerging technologies in aquaculture.\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n4 of 25\nTable 1.

However, several identified deficiencies\npersist. First, many works have not integrated quantum algorithms to optimize data pro-\ncessing, limiting ML models’ capacities to handle large volumes of real-time data—an\nessential feature in aquaculture systems that operate with multiple environmental vari-\nables [17]. For instance, a study using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Backpropagation\nNeural Network (BPNN) models for predicting water quality is effective in forecasting\nkey parameters such as pH and dissolved oxygen but lacks a quantum approach that\ncould improve processing time efficiency [25]. Similarly, studies exploring solutions for\nrecirculating aquaculture systems do not address the potential for optimization through\nquantum algorithms, which could accelerate prediction and response processes [21].\nAnother notable deficiency is the lack of scalability in rural areas. Studies highlight the\nchallenges of implementing IoT and ML solutions in regions with limited connectivity [18,26].\nThese studies reveal that, while IoT technologies are effective in areas with advanced\ninfrastructure, their implementation in rural regions requires more robust and cost-effective\nsolutions, such as using Long Range (LoRa) technologies to improve connectivity.\nThis study addresses several of the deficiencies identified in the literature. First, it pro-\nposes the integration of quantum algorithms like the Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA) to reduce processing times in ML models. This not only enhances the\nefficiency of water quality prediction but also allows for faster and more accurate real-time\ndecision-making, a key feature in aquaculture systems that requires immediate responses\nto environmental changes [27].\nMoreover, this work offers a scalable solution for rural areas using technologies such\nas LoRa and low-power networks to improve data transmission in regions without access\nto high-speed internet. This represents a significant advancement in making IoT technology\naccessible in aquaculture systems in developing countries, where connectivity is a major\nobstacle [20].\nIt is crucial for future research in aquaculture to focus on scalability, the integration of\nquantum algorithms, and the development of hybrid predictive models. The use of low-\npower networks like Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has proven effective\nfor water quality monitoring in rural areas, allowing real-time data transmission with\nlow energy consumption. This technology is key to overcoming connectivity barriers in\nregions with limited infrastructure, facilitating the adoption of the IoT in aquaculture [21].\nFurthermore, the integration of the QAOA with ML can significantly improve the accuracy\nand speed of decision-making in aquaculture systems [28,29].\n3.

Key vari-\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n6 of 25\nables such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and turbidity were continuously\nmonitored to assess water quality, which is crucial for the health of fish in aquaculture\nenvironments. The IoT system architecture is modular and designed for real-time operation,\nwith sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi that manages data collection and transmits it\nwirelessly, as shown in Figures 1–3 [4,10,30,31].\n \nFigure 1. Real-time monitoring system with sensors connected in aquaculture environment.\n \nFigure 2. Monitoring device with waterproof protection for electronic components.\nFigure 3. UML class diagram of IoT and Machine Learning system for water quality monitoring.\n3.1. Study Site\nThe research was conducted in artificial ponds located in Montería, Córdoba, Colombia\n(8.7867◦N, 75.8399◦W), an area characterized by a tropical climate with temperatures\nranging between 24 ◦C and 30 ◦C. These ponds, supplied by natural springs, maintain\na steady water flow, providing a stable aquaculture environment that influences water\nquality and fish health. This setup allows for a controlled assessment of environmental\nconditions and their impact on aquaculture [17].\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n7 of 25\n3.2. IoT System Architecture\nThe IoT system is designed to enable real-time monitoring and the adaptive man-\nagement of water quality. Sensors were deployed to measure temperature, pH, dissolved\noxygen (DO), and turbidity, transmitting data to a Raspberry Pi, which serves as the central\nprocessing unit (CPU). The Raspberry Pi stores data locally and sends it to a remote server\nover Wi-Fi for further analysis. Additionally, the system integrates an anomaly detection\nmodule that uses a Random Forest model to identify deviations in water quality parameters.\nDetected anomalies trigger automatic alerts and are recorded for further investigation and\nsystem calibration.\nTo ensure continuous accuracy, the IoT system incorporates an automated model\nupdating process. Real-time data collected by the sensors are used to retrain the ML model\nat regular intervals. This retraining process employs a sliding window approach, where\nthe most recent 1000 records are combined with historical data to capture recent trends and\npatterns. Although 24 h intervals were used to monitor real-time performance, retraining\noccurred approximately every 41 days as new data accumulated to reach the required\ndataset size. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) was employed\nto optimize hyperparameters, significantly reducing retraining time and ensuring seamless\nintegration of updated models into the system.\nA Django-based web interface was created to visualize data in real-time, configure\nalert thresholds, and enable remote monitoring by users. Figure 1 shows the monitoring\nsystem setup in the field, while Figure 2 presents the device within a waterproof enclosure\nto protect its electronic components from environmental factors.\nTo further illustrate the IoT system’s architecture and the interactions between its\ncomponents, Figure 3 presents a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram. This\ndiagram clarifies the communication between the sensors, Raspberry Pi, server, ML models,\nand user interface. Figure 4 provides an architectural diagram of the IoT system, while\nFigure 5 shows the trends observed in water quality parameters over time.\nFigure 4. IoT system architecture for water quality monitoring.\nThe integration of real-time IoT data and periodic model updates ensures the system’s\nadaptability to changing environmental conditions. This capability enables the early\ndetection of water quality anomalies and supports timely interventions to maintain optimal\naquaculture conditions.\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n8 of 25\nFigure 5. Observed trends in water quality parameters over time.\n3.3. Data Management and Transmission\nThe detailed pseudocode for managing data obtained from the sensors and trans-\nmitting it to the database and server is presented below. This algorithm is essential for\nreal-time data collection, processing, and storage, ensuring the effectiveness of the monitor-\ning system.\nAlgorithm 1 provides the basic structure for continuous monitoring and sensor data\nmanagement, ensuring that any deviation from acceptable parameters is immediately\nreported to system operators.\nAlgorithm 1: IoT Data Management\nInput: Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity sensors; Wi-Fi connection; database.\nOutput: Data stored in the database and server.\n1.\nInitialize temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity sensors.\n2.\nWhile the system is operational:\no\nFor each connected sensor:\n1.\nObtain the current measurement from sensor SiSiSi.\n2.\nIf SiSiSi measurement is within the expected range:\n■\nContinue monitoring.\n3.\nIf SiSiSi measurement exceeds the predefined threshold:\n■\nSend an alert to the monitoring system.\n4.\nSave the measurement in the local database.\n5.\nTransmit the data via Wi-Fi to the server.\n6.\nUpdate the web interface with the new data for real-time visualization.\n3.\nEnd of loop.\nFigure 6 illustrates the architectural sequence of the IoT system, detailing the inter-\nactions between the sensors, Raspberry Pi, database, Django interface, and server. This\nsequence diagram complements Algorithm 1 by visually representing the steps involved in\ndata acquisition, threshold adjustment, storage, and real-time visualization.\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n9 of 25\nFigure 6. Architectural diagram of IoT system for water quality monitoring and real-time visualization.\n3.4. Sensor Calibration and Maintenance\nBefore deployment, the sensors were calibrated using ISO 5814:2012 [32] and ISO\n10523:2008 [33] standards for DO and pH, respectively. Calibration was performed every\n15 days to ensure measurement accuracy under varying environmental conditions in the\nponds [34]. While offline calibration was applied, future implementations should consider\ninline calibration and periodic maintenance routines, particularly for pH and DO electrodes,\nto maintain sensor reliability.\n3.5. Data Collection and Dataset\nA total of 4383 records were collected, capturing temperature (◦C), dissolved oxygen\n(mg/L), pH, and turbidity (NTU). Data were recorded every hour, and the dataset is\npublicly available in the Mendeley Data repository (DOI: [10.17632/dgdr2kfbyt.1]). The\nmonitored variables and their normalized values (temperature and DO scaled for predictive\nmodeling) are presented in Table 2.\nAlthough the observed variability of the water quality indicators was limited, this\nreflects the controlled conditions typical of aquaculture ponds in Montería, Córdoba. These\nconditions are consistent with stable tropical environments, where moderate fluctuations\ncan still lead to critical risks for fish health. To ensure the feasibility of anomaly detection,\nthe dataset was enriched by establishing dynamic thresholds based on both historical\ntrends and domain-specific benchmarks. These thresholds enabled the identification of\nsubtle deviations that could impact fish survival rates.\nThe following are examples of the identified deviations:\n•\nDissolved oxygen (DO): Levels below 5 mg/L were identified as critical, correlating\nwith increased fish stress and mortality risks.\n•\nTemperature: Variations above 28 ◦C significantly influenced DO levels, necessitating\nactive oxygenation measures during warmer months.\n•\nTurbidity and pH: Deviations from optimal ranges (>4 NTU for turbidity, 7.0–8.5 for\npH) highlighted the need for filtration and pH stabilization interventions.\nThese adjustments ensured that the dataset provided sufficient granularity for training\nthe Random Forest model to detect and predict anomalies, aligning the observations with\npractical aquaculture management needs.\nDataset Description:\n•\nTemperature (◦C): Measurement of water temperature.\n•\nDissolved oxygen (mg/L): Reflects the concentration of oxygen in the water.\n•\npH: Indicates the acidity or alkalinity of the water.\n•\nTurbidity (NTU): Represents the clarity or turbidity level of the water.\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n10 of 25\n•\nNormalized values: Scaled values for temperature and dissolved oxygen, used for\npredictive modeling.\nTable 2.

Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE)\nTo assess water quality under the specific tropical conditions of Montería, the Fuzzy\nComprehensive Evaluation (FCE) methodology was applied. This technique classified\nthe monitored parameters—temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and turbidity—into\nquality ranges of “Good”, “Moderate”, and “Poor”, adapted to local standards. These\nranges were established to facilitate data interpretation within the environmental context\nof Montería, enhancing the accuracy of evaluations on factors affecting fish health in an\naquaculture setting. This fuzzy evaluation helps to fine-tune system alerts and recommen-\ndations, providing a more robust analytical tool for continuous IoT monitoring [35].\n3.7. Data Preprocessing\nData normalization was applied to continuous variables using Min-Max Scaling, as\nshown in Equation (1), which facilitates integration into the predictive models (Random\nForest and SVM) [36].\nXnorm =\nX −Xmin\nXmax −Xmin\n(1)\nwhere\n•\nXnorm is the normalized value;\n•\nX is the original value of the variable;\n•\nXmin is the minimum value in the dataset;\n•\nXmax is the maximum value in the dataset.\n3.8. Machine Learning Model Selection and Implementation\nTwo Machine Learning algorithms were selected for their robust performance with\ncomplex datasets: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).\nRandom Forest: This model consists of multiple decision trees, each trained on a\nrandom subset of the data. Hyperparameters were tuned to use 100 trees with a maximum\ndepth of 10, providing an optimal balance between bias and variance [37,38]. Algorithm 2\nprovides the detailed steps for implementing the Random Forest model, which ensures\nrobust regression results.\nAlgorithm 2: Random Forest\nInput: Training data (Xtrain, Ytrain), ntrees = 100, max_depth = 10\nOutput: Trained model for prediction\n1.\nInitialize Random Forest with specified parameters.\n2.\nFor each tree in the forest:\na.\nCreate a bootstrap sample.\nb.\nTrain the decision tree on the sample.\n3.\nAggregate predictions (average for regression).\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n11 of 25\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM): This algorithm used a radial basis function (RBF)\nkernel with a penalty parameter C = 1.0, suitable for predicting nonlinear relationships\nin water quality data, particularly for pH and DO [22]. Algorithm 3 outlines the steps\ninvolved in the implementation of the SVM, emphasizing the initialization, training, and\noptimization phases.\nAlgorithm 3: SVM\nInput: Training data (Xtrain, Ytrain), C = 1.0, kernel = RBF\nOutput: Trained model for prediction\n1.\nInitialize SVM with specified kernel and penalty.\n2.\nTrain to maximize margin.\n3.\nOptimize hyperplane with support vectors.\n3.9. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for Real-Time Processing\nTo reduce model training time, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm\n(QAOA) was applied, cutting processing time by 50% compared to traditional methods\nlike Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) [27–29].\nThe cost function for the QAOA is shown in Equation (2) as follows:\nC(γ, β) =\n\nψ(γ, β)\n\f\f ˆC\n\f\fψ(γ, β)\n\u000b\n(2)\nwhere\n•\nγ and β are the adjustable parameters of the algorithm;\n•\nψ(γ,β) is the generated quantum state;\n•\nˆC is the cost operator that defines the optimization problem.\nAlgorithm 4 provides the pseudocode for implementing the QAOA, detailing the\nsteps for initializing parameters, evaluating the cost function, and adjusting parameters\nthrough gradient descent for optimization.\nAlgorithm 4: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)\nInput: ML model, initial parameters γ, β, training data D_train\nOutput: Optimized model with reduced training time\n1.\nInitialize γ, β randomly.\n2.\nFor each iteration:\na.\nRun quantum state ψ(γ, β).\nb.\nEvaluate cost function.\nc.\nAdjust γ, β with gradient descent.\n3.10. Model Evaluation and Metrics\nPerformance metrics included Root Relative Mean Squared Prediction Error (RRM-\nSPE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\nThe RRMSPE, RRMSE, and MAPE results are as follows [6,36,39]:\n•\nRRMSPE (1.44%): This indicates the model deviates on average by 1.44% from actual\nvalues, which is satisfactory for predictive applications in the IoT for aquaculture,\nwhere low error margins are critical [40].\n•\nMAPE (3.99%): An MAPE of 3.99% reflects a low mean percentage error, generally\nbelow 5%, which confirms high precision in relative predictions, beneficial for applica-\ntions requiring specific value accuracy, like fish weight [41].\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n12 of 25\n•\nRRMSE (1.439789%): Calculated from the scaled RMSE of 0.099772 mg/L, it reflects\nrelative error in terms of percentage, which is ideal for assessing model performance\nacross varied parameter ranges [42].\n3.11. Coefficient of Determination (R2)\nThe coefficient of determination R2, shown in Equation (3), was also used to measure\naccuracy, achieving a value of 0.990255, which confirms high prediction accuracy [43–45].\nR2 = 1 −∑(yi −ˆyi)2\n∑(yi −y)2\n(3)\nwhere\n•\nyi are the observed values;\n•\nˆyi are the values predicted by the model;\n•\ny is the mean of the observed data.\nBy integrating ML and the QAOA, the system achieved a robust predictive capability,\nhighlighting quantum algorithms’ potential in real-time, high-precision applications. The\nmodels demonstrated improved responsiveness, accuracy, and efficiency, making this\nsystem a viable tool for aquaculture management.\n4. Results\nThe continuous monitoring of aquaculture ponds revealed significant variations in\nkey environmental factors directly influencing water quality and fish health. Observations\nfocused on parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and turbidity,\nwhich displayed distinctive patterns over time, are crucial for sustainable aquaculture\npractices. For this analysis, a Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) was applied, with\nparameter quality ranges adjusted to the specific conditions of Montería, enabling a more\naccurate assessment of water quality in a tropical environment [35].\n4.1. Analysis of Relationship Between Turbidity and Dissolved Oxygen\nThe relationship between turbidity (NTU) and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels was\nanalyzed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and robust regression methods. The OLS\nregression yielded a slope of 0.0091 with a standard error of 0.0215, while the robust\nregression resulted in a slope of 0.0058 with a standard error of 0.0218. In both cases,\nthe p-values (0.671 for OLS and 0.791 for robust regression) indicate that the slope is not\nstatistically significant, confirming a null tendency.\nThese results suggest that variations in turbidity have a negligible effect on DO levels\nwithin the experimental range. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that DO\nlevels demonstrate resilience under moderate turbidity variations, which is critical in\naquaculture systems where turbidity fluctuations are often caused by feed waste and fish\nactivity. Previous studies have also identified that water quality and poor husbandry\npractices can significantly affect oxygen levels and, consequently, fish mortality [46].\nThe regression lines and their respective 95% confidence intervals are presented in\nFigure 7. The robust regression method was included to ensure reliability against potential\noutliers in the data, further confirming the null sloping tendency observed in the OLS analysis.\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n13 of 25\nFigure 7. Relationship between turbidity and dissolved oxygen with 95% confidence intervals (OLS\nand robust regression).\n4.2. Daily Relationship Between Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen\nThe daily relationship between temperature (◦C) and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels\nwas analyzed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and robust regression methods. The\nOLS regression yielded a slope of 0.0097 with a standard error of 0.0156 and a p-value of\n0.534, indicating that the slope is not statistically significant. Similarly, the robust regression\nproduced a slope of 0.0067 with a standard error of 0.0158 and a p-value of 0.671, confirming\na null sloping tendency within the analyzed dataset.\nThese results suggest that, under the specific conditions of this study in Montería,\nCórdoba, no statistically significant relationship between temperature and DO levels was\ndetected. However, this does not contradict the well-established understanding that\nhigher temperatures reduce water’s capacity to retain dissolved oxygen [47]. Instead, it\nhighlights that the inverse relationship may be less apparent in experimental contexts\nwhere temperature variations are moderate or where external factors, such as oxygenation\nsystems or controlled environmental conditions, mitigate this effect.\nThis analysis underscores the importance of proactive management of DO levels\nin aquaculture systems, particularly in tropical regions like Montería, where seasonal\ntemperature variations may require additional strategies to maintain optimal conditions.\nFigure 8 illustrates the relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen, featuring\nboth OLS and robust regression lines with their respective 95% confidence intervals, offering\na clear and comprehensive representation of the findings.\nFigure 8. Daily relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen with 95% confidence intervals\n(OLS and robust regression).\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n14 of 25\n4.3. Normalized Time Series of Daily Averages of Water Quality Parameters\nFigure 9 shows the normalized time series of daily averages of water quality parame-\nters, including temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and turbidity. This graph allows\nfor the observation of daily trends and variations for each parameter throughout the study\nperiod, highlighting the characteristic fluctuations of the tropical environment in Montería,\nCórdoba, and their potential impact on water quality [7,13,35].\nFigure 9. Normalized time series of daily averages of water quality parameters.\n4.4. Correlation Matrix of Water Quality Parameters\nFigure 10 presents the correlation matrix of water quality parameters, allowing for\nan analysis of the relationships between them. The lack of strong correlations indicates\nthat these parameters behave relatively independently, suggesting that each parameter\nmay respond differently to environmental changes. This analysis is crucial for developing\nspecific and appropriate interventions for each parameter in the aquaculture context [46,48].\nFigure 10. Correlation matrix of water quality parameters.\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n15 of 25\n4.5. Performance of Dissolved Oxygen Model and Limitations in Other Parameters\nThe optimized Random Forest model achieved high precision in predicting DO levels,\nwith an RMSE of 0.744 and an R2 of 1.0. This accuracy highlights the model’s capability\nto account for DO fluctuations under local conditions. However, parameters such as tem-\nperature, pH, and turbidity did not consistently align with optimal aquaculture standards.\nTo address this, a Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) approach was implemented,\nadjusting membership ranges to fit Montería’s water quality context (see Table 3). The\nFCE adjustment provides a better representation of local tropical conditions, where factors\nlike seasonal rainfall and high temperatures impact water quality, often deviating from\ntraditional aquaculture norms [15,43].\nThe following are examples of the system’s adjustments:\n•\nDuring warmer months, when temperatures exceeded 28 ◦C (classified as “Mod-\nerate” by the FCE), the system detected declines in DO and triggered oxygenation\ninterventions.\n•\nElevated turbidity (>4 NTU) indicated organic matter accumulation, prompting filtra-\ntion and aeration.\nThe integration of these thresholds into the ML model not only improved anomaly\ndetection but also enabled timely corrective interventions, maintaining fish survival rates\nabove 90% during the study period.\nTable 3. Adjusted FCE membership ranges for water quality parameters in Montería.\nParameter\nGood Range\nModerate Range\nPoor Range\nTemperature (◦C)\n24–27\n27–29\n29–30\nDissolved Oxygen (mg/L)\n5–8\n3–5\n2–3\npH\n6.5–8\n5.5–6.5\n4–5.5\nTurbidity (NTU)\n1–5\n5–7\n7–9\nFCE categorized water quality into “Good”, “Moderate”, and “Poor” ranges. DO was\nlargely within the “Good” range, while temperature and pH fluctuated between “Moderate”\nand “Poor” during warmer months. This emphasizes the importance of interventions like\noxygenation and filtration to mitigate environmental impacts and ensure optimal water\nquality [15,43].\nThe FCE provided complementary insights into traditional metrics such as RMSE and\nR2, offering a more nuanced perspective on critical water quality variations. For example,\nwhile traditional metrics indicated high model precision, the FCE framework facilitated the\nidentification of conditions requiring immediate intervention by categorizing parameters\ninto actionable quality ranges. This dual approach ensured that both predictive accuracy\nand practical relevance were maintained, enhancing the system’s ability to detect and\nrespond to adverse environmental changes effectively.\n4.6. Integration of Anomaly Detection and Real-Time Model Updates\nThe IoT–ML system effectively detected water quality anomalies in real-time, trigger-\ning corrective actions to mitigate environmental risks. Anomalies, such as low dissolved\noxygen (DO) levels and elevated turbidity, were identified by the Random Forest model,\nwhich compared sensor data to dynamic thresholds established through historical and\nreal-time data analysis. Specifically, the Random Forest model utilized historical datasets\nto define baseline ranges and patterns, while the incorporation of real-time sensor data\nallowed the system to detect deviations promptly. This integration ensured that both long-\nterm trends and sudden changes were accounted for during anomaly detection [49,50].\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n16 of 25\nTo ensure the accuracy and adaptability of the predictive model, a sliding window\napproach was implemented to update the Random Forest model at regular intervals. This\nprocess incorporated the most recent 1000 data records alongside historical datasets to\ncapture evolving trends and patterns. While real-time data were monitored continuously,\nmodel retraining occurred approximately every 41 days, reflecting the time required to\naccumulate sufficient new records (see Table 4 for Random Forest performance metrics).\nThe combination of historical data and periodic updates enabled the system to refine\nits thresholds dynamically, ensuring robust detection of water quality anomalies across\nvarying environmental conditions (see Table 5 for cross-validation metrics and Table 6 for\nindependent test results). For example, historical data identified a critical DO threshold of\n5 mg/L, below which fish survival rates declined, prompting the system to issue alerts and\ntrigger oxygenation interventions automatically.\nThe Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) reduced retraining time\nby 50%, allowing for the seamless deployment of updated models without interrupting\nreal-time operations. Studies in anomaly detection for optical networks and time series data\nhave highlighted the value of combining dynamic updates with optimization algorithms to\nenhance system reliability [49,51].\nThe system’s ability to detect anomalies and respond promptly had a measurable\nimpact on aquaculture productivity. For instance, during warmer months, it maintained\ndissolved oxygen levels within optimal ranges, contributing to survival rates above 90%\n(see Table 7 for fish survival rates and corrective interventions). These findings demonstrate\nthe practical advantages of integrating the IoT, ML, and quantum optimization for real-time\naquaculture management. Furthermore, this study builds on prior work by demonstrat-\ning the specific benefits of real-time model updates in mitigating environmental risks in\naquaculture [51,52].\n4.7. Integration of QAOA in Predictive Model: Training Time Optimization\nImplementing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in the\nMachine Learning model optimized parameter settings and significantly reduced training\ntime by 50%, from 120 s to 60 s. This advancement is crucial for real-time monitoring\nin aquaculture, where rapid responses can prevent critical incidents (see Table 4). The\nQAOA enables quicker decision-making, essential for mitigating risks and enhancing\nenvironmental data management efficiency in aquaculture systems [23,48].\nTable 4. Performance of Random Forest model.\nMetric\nValue\nR2\n0.999\nRMSE\n0.0998 mg/L\nRRMSE (%)\n1.44%\n4.8. Model Accuracy Evaluation: Factor R\nThe high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.999) and low RMSE (0.0998 mg/L)\nachieved by the optimized model demonstrate its capability to capture critical water quality\npatterns with high precision. These metrics not only reflect the model’s robustness but also\nhave direct implications for real-time decision-making. For instance, a low RMSE ensures\nthat the model’s predictions are close to actual values, enabling immediate adjustments\nto oxygenation or filtration systems. Similarly, the high R2 value indicates that the model\ncan explain nearly all variability in water quality data, enhancing confidence in automated\ninterventions in dynamic aquaculture environments [53].\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n17 of 25\n4.9. Model Validation Through Cross-Validation and Independent Testing\nThe 10-fold cross-validation and independent testing confirmed the model’s robust-\nness in generalizing predictions across various environmental conditions. Table 5 presents\nthe average results of R2, MSE, and RRMSPE from the cross-validation folds. This level of\nprecision is critical for real-time monitoring systems as it minimizes the risk of incorrect\ndecisions based on erroneous data. Furthermore, the consistent RMSE and R2 values across\nall tests ensure the model’s reliability, even when faced with environmental fluctuations\ntypical of tropical aquaculture settings [54].\nTable 5.

Corrective Interventions and Impact on Fish Health\nThroughout the study, more than 6000 corrective interventions were conducted, par-\nticularly during warmer months when high temperatures and low dissolved oxygen (DO)\nlevels posed elevated risks. These interventions, including oxygenation and pH adjust-\nments, were automatically triggered when parameters deviated from optimal levels. The\nQAOA-enabled system allowed for timely responses, significantly reducing fish stress and\nmaintaining survival rates above 90% across a total of 10,000 fish distributed among the\naquaculture ponds (see Table 7) [21,23,40,55].\nRecent studies have demonstrated that integrating the IoT and ML in aquaculture\nsystems, such as real-time monitoring systems, can significantly reduce mortality by opti-\nmizing environmental parameters and automating interventions [7,13]. For instance, the\nimplementation of LSTM neural networks to predict water quality parameters has shown\npromising results in reducing losses [56]. Furthermore, automation through systems like\nAqua Colony, which uses fish activity data to optimize feeding, reinforces the viability of\nthese technologies to enhance sustainability and productivity [57].\nIn uncontrolled environments, previous studies have reported mortality rates ranging\nfrom 15% to 30%, even with basic oxygenation measures [7,13]. In comparison, the observed\nmortality rates in this study were significantly lower, ranging from 4.86% (January) to 7.15%\n(June), validating the effectiveness of the proposed system in mitigating risks associated\nwith adverse environmental factors. For example, during the warm months of May and\nJune, when average temperatures exceeded 28 ◦C, the system maintained survival rates\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n18 of 25\nof 92.93% and 92.85%, respectively, demonstrating its capability to proactively respond to\ncritical conditions [58].\nTable 7.

This highlights the positive impact of an IoT–ML system with automated\ninterventions on the sustainability and productivity of aquaculture operations.\n5. Discussion\nThis study presents an innovative approach to aquaculture management by integrating\nthe Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and quantum optimization technolo-\ngies, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and predictive analytics for\nwater quality control. By addressing key gaps in existing research—such as limited compu-\ntational efficiency and adaptability to resource-constrained environments—the proposed\nsystem advances the field with significant practical and academic contributions.\nThrough the use of sensors to measure key parameters such as temperature, pH, tur-\nbidity, and dissolved oxygen (DO), the system enabled real-time adjustments that helped\nmaintain optimal conditions for fish health. Unlike traditional systems, the integration of\nthe Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) resulted in a 50% reduction\nin model training time (from 120 s to 60 s), providing rapid responses crucial for real-time\naquaculture management. This enhancement demonstrates the system’s capacity to miti-\ngate risks associated with sudden water quality fluctuations, ensuring timely interventions\nthat protect fish health and minimize productivity losses.\nThe Random Forest model, optimized and validated through K-fold cross-validation\nand independent testing, demonstrated high accuracy (R2 = 0.999, RMSE = 0.0998 mg/L),\nestablishing itself as a reliable tool for predicting critical water quality variables in a tropical\naquaculture setting [7,13,35,46,48]. Moreover, this study extends the utility of Random\nForest by demonstrating its integration with the QAOA, a combination not previously\nexplored in aquaculture, enabling predictive analytics to operate efficiently even in rural or\nresource-limited settings.\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n19 of 25\nA notable aspect of this study is the practical implementation framework, designed to\nbe adaptable to both resource-limited rural areas and fully equipped urban environments.\nTable 8 provides a step-by-step methodology adaptable to varying technological infrastruc-\ntures. For rural settings, low-cost sensors and offline data storage solutions, such as SD\ncards and Raspberry Pi units, offer feasible options. In contrast, advanced technological\nenvironments can utilize cloud-based systems and real-time data processing for more\ndynamic and responsive aquaculture management [23,59]. This methodological flexibility\nenhances the replicability of the IoT–ML system across different contexts, ensuring that\naquaculture facilities worldwide can benefit regardless of local infrastructure constraints.\nTable 8.

These stable yet dynamic conditions allowed for the consistent\nmonitoring of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, highlighting how tropical\nclimates influence water quality variability. For instance, the steady temperature range\nmitigated extreme fluctuations in DO levels, enabling the Random Forest model to achieve\nhigh precision in anomaly detection. Similar applications of IoT-based monitoring systems\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n20 of 25\nin tropical aquaculture contexts have demonstrated the effectiveness of Random Forest\nalgorithms for maintaining water quality [7,60].\nThe findings from this study provide valuable insights into aquaculture operations in\nsimilar tropical regions. While the thresholds and intervention strategies developed here\nare tailored to Montería, they can be adapted for other tropical environments with com-\nparable climatic characteristics, such as those found in Southeast Asia and Central Africa.\nAdjusting the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) parameters to account for regional\nvariations, such as more pronounced seasonal changes or differences in natural turbidity,\nwould ensure a broader applicability of this approach. Previous studies on IoT frameworks\nand monitoring systems in aquaculture highlight the potential for scalability and adapt-\nability of such technologies, even under diverse environmental conditions [13,25,61]. This\nadaptability underscores the relevance of the IoT–ML–QAOA framework as a scalable\nsolution for aquaculture management in diverse tropical settings.\nMoreover, integrating sustainability principles into IoT–ML systems has demonstrated\nbroader applications beyond aquaculture, particularly in sectors that require a balance\nbetween environmental impact and operational efficiency. For instance, the combination of\nlife cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategies has\nproven effective for scaling IoT implementations in the food industry, offering a roadmap\nadaptable to aquaculture practices [42,62]. This integration has yielded significant benefits,\nsuch as a 20% reduction in operational costs and a 10% increase in market share for\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food sector, based on comparative\nanalyses conducted between 2019 and 2023 [24]. These methodologies provide a replicable\nframework for promoting sustainability and operational efficiency, addressing critical\nchallenges in aquaculture by balancing environmental responsibility with productivity.\nA key innovation of this study lies in the integration of real-time anomaly detection\nand dynamic model updates to address fluctuating water quality conditions in aquaculture\nsystems. The IoT–ML system utilized a Random Forest model to detect deviations in\ncritical parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO) and turbidity, triggering automated\ncorrective actions. These interventions, including adjustments in oxygenation and pH\nlevels, were essential during critical periods such as the warmer months when elevated\ntemperatures increased risks to fish health. Over 6000 anomalies were identified and\naddressed during the study, demonstrating the system’s capability to support proactive\naquaculture management. Similar approaches to anomaly detection in time series and\nenvironmental monitoring were discussed in studies that integrate Random Forest and\nrelated ML techniques [49,51].\nTo maintain the model’s accuracy and adaptability, a sliding window approach was\nimplemented for periodic updates. The Random Forest model was retrained approximately\nevery 41 days, reflecting the time required to accumulate 1000 new data records, which were\ncombined with historical datasets. This approach ensured its responsiveness to evolving\nenvironmental patterns while accounting for the controlled data collection frequency\nin aquaculture systems. The integration of the Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm (QAOA) further optimized this process by reducing training time by 50%,\nenabling the seamless deployment of updated models without interrupting real-time\noperations. This dynamic updating mechanism ensures the continuous alignment of\nthe model with current water quality trends, which is critical for sustaining aquaculture\nproductivity in variable environmental conditions. Techniques for integrating model\nretraining and optimization, like sliding windows and the QAOA, have shown significant\npotential in maintaining real-time system adaptability [50,52].\nThe IoT–ML system’s ability to continuously collect extensive data enables both real-\ntime and long-term pattern analysis. This is particularly innovative when coupled with\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n21 of 25\nthe QAOA, which accelerates predictive processing to facilitate rapid decision-making.\nConstant monitoring not only optimizes immediate interventions but also supports the\nidentification of seasonal patterns and climate-induced changes over time. These insights\ncontribute to a deeper understanding of environmental dynamics in aquaculture, reinforc-\ning the role of IoT–ML–QAOA technology in sustainable aquaculture management.\nThe integration of the QAOA in the model training process resulted in a significant\nreduction in training time, from 120 s to 60 s. This improvement is particularly valuable for\nreal-time aquaculture applications, where rapid decision-making is essential to mitigate\nenvironmental risks and support fish health. Unlike previous studies that focus on static\nmonitoring or semi-automated systems, this research demonstrates how quantum opti-\nmization can be practically deployed to enhance predictive efficiency in real-world settings.\nAs cloud-based quantum platforms by companies such as IBM and Google become more\naccessible, this system has the potential to democratize advanced aquaculture management\npractices [63–65].\nThis study conducted over 6000 corrective interventions, including adjustments in\noxygenation, pH balancing, and turbidity control, particularly during warmer months\n(May and June) when elevated temperatures and reduced DO levels posed higher risks\nto fish health. Maintaining monthly survival rates above 90% showcases the operational\neffectiveness of the system, offering a clear advantage over traditional approaches [46,47].\nFuture research opportunities include incorporating renewable energy sources like\nsolar panels to make IoT-based monitoring systems more sustainable, particularly in off-\ngrid rural locations. Expanding monitored parameters to include emerging contaminants\nand microbiological variables would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of water\nquality, supporting better aquaculture management over the long-term [66]. Additionally,\nintegrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as deep neural networks,\ncould enhance predictive accuracy, enabling the system to detect complex water quality\npatterns. These advancements in AI would support more efficient aquaculture management,\neven in fully automated facilities and resource-constrained environments [38,41].\nBy combining the IoT, ML, and quantum-enhanced predictive algorithms, this study\nprovides a transformative approach to aquaculture management. The methodological flexi-\nbility detailed in Table 8 ensures that this system can be adapted to various resource settings,\nmaking it a valuable tool for sustainable aquaculture worldwide. As quantum computing\nbecomes more accessible, systems like this will play an increasingly pivotal role in enhanc-\ning food security and promoting resilient, eco-friendly aquaculture practices [23,43,64].\n6. Conclusions\nThe study demonstrates that emerging technological solutions, such as the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, have the potential to transform\naquaculture management through the continuous monitoring of critical water quality pa-\nrameters. The integration of sensors to measure key indicators like temperature, dissolved\noxygen (DO), pH, and turbidity, combined with advanced predictive models such as Ran-\ndom Forest, showcased remarkable predictive capabilities. These models achieved high\naccuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.999 and a root mean squared error\n(RMSE) of 0.0998 mg/L, enabling timely responses to fluctuations in water conditions. By\nstabilizing the aquatic environment, this approach fosters a healthier ecosystem for fish,\ndirectly improving productivity and promoting system sustainability.\nThe results highlight the positive impact of integrating the IoT and ML in enhancing\nproductivity and sustainability in aquaculture. The IoT–ML system enabled continuous\nreal-time monitoring, significantly reducing fish mortality rates and achieving survival rates\nabove 90%, even during high-temperature periods when variations in temperature and\nWater 2025, 17, 82\n22 of 25\nDO typically pose significant risks to fish health. This ability to stabilize pond conditions\nand enhance survival rates underscores the practical utility of these systems in real-world\naquaculture operations, surpassing purely theoretical scenarios.\nIn rural settings, challenges such as limited internet connectivity and financial con-\nstraints necessitate adaptable solutions tailored to these conditions. This study proposes\na flexible and replicable methodology that facilitates the implementation of monitoring\nsystems even in resource-limited environments. The use of accessible technologies, such\nas Raspberry Pi microcomputers and low-cost sensors, provides a practical alternative\nthat empowers rural communities to collect and analyze data locally without relying on\nadvanced infrastructure. This broadens the accessibility of these technologies in regions\nwhere aquaculture is vital for economic sustainability and food security, reaffirming their\nrelevance across diverse socioeconomic contexts.\nOne of the study’s key contributions is the integration of the Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm (QAOA), which effectively halved model processing times—a\ncritical advancement for real-time monitoring. However, adopting quantum computing\napplications remains limited in rural areas due to technological and infrastructural con-\nstraints. Future research should focus on developing adaptable quantum solutions, such\nas quantum simulators that bypass the need for specialized hardware, to foster a broader\nadoption in varied contexts. This would facilitate the application of quantum computing in\nreal-time predictive aquaculture systems, enhancing operational efficiency globally.\nAdditionally, incorporating renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, within aqua-\nculture monitoring systems could significantly enhance sustainability and self-sufficiency.\nExpanding the scope of monitored parameters to include emerging contaminants and\nmicrobiological indicators would allow for a more comprehensive analysis of water quality,\noptimizing decision-making processes and strengthening ecosystem resilience. These ad-\nvancements, alongside the continuous development of predictive models and IoT technolo-\ngies, have the potential to revolutionize aquaculture management worldwide, contributing\nto sustainable water resource utilization and bolstering food security. By addressing both\ntechnological and environmental challenges, this research lays the groundwork for a more\nresilient and efficient future in sustainable aquaculture practices.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R., and J.P.-L.; methodology, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R.,\nF.T.-H., and J.P.-L.; validation, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R., and J.P.-L.; formal analysis, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R., and\nJ.P.-L.; investigation, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R., F.T.-H., and J.P.-L.; resources, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R., F.T.-H., and\nJ.P.-L.; data curation, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R., F.T.-H., and J.P.-L.; writing—original draft preparation, R.B.-N.,\nY.C.-R., F.T.-H., and J.P.-L.; writing—review and editing, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R., and J.P.-L.; visualization,\nR.B.-N., Y.C.-R., and J.P.-L.; supervision, R.B.-N., Y.C.-R., F.T.-H., and J.P.-L.; project administration,\nR.B.-N., Y.C.-R., F.T.-H., and J.P.-L.

        "content": "Title: Autonomous and Continuous Water Quality Monitoring \n \nOur goal is to deliver reliable and timely water quality data,  by deploying autonomous \nsensors, such as multiparameter sondes, we can continuously monitor key water \nparameters with efficiency and precision. Our hybrid approaches also combining \nsatellite remote sensing, and continuous autonomous in-situ sensors with wireless \ntelemetry provides the best solution to remotely monitor water quality in the Rhône river. \nThis approach leverages the strengths of each method to achieve spatial \ncoverage, temporal frequency, and detailed water quality parameter \nmeasurement. \n \nIn-situ sensors required properties:                                    \n●​ Comprehensive Measurements: Multiparameter sondes should track \nessential indicators like pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, and \ntemperature simultaneously, providing a full picture of water quality. \n●​ Continuous, Autonomous Logging: These devices should operate autonomously \nafter deployment, logging measurements around the clock with minimal need for \nmanual intervention. \n●​ Rugged Design: Built for the outdoors, these sensors should be designed to \nwithstand harsh river conditions and guarantee reliable performance over \nextended periods. \n●​ Easy Setup & Field Deployment \n●​ Wireless Data Transmission \n \nRemote sensing and monitoring of the water quality  \n1.​ Ground based monitoring system   - an intelligent vision system to \nmonitor water quality without direct contact. \n●​ Visual Monitoring: Fixed cameras positioned overlooking rivers or lakes \ncapture time-lapse or live images showing water color, surface turbidity, \nsediment plumes, algal blooms, and floating debris. Changes in these \nvisual cues can indicate shifts in water quality. \n●​ A system with multispectral imaging technology combined with artificial \nintelligence to analyze optical characteristics of water quality indicators \nfrom the spectral data. \n●​ This non-contact method allows for continuous, real-time monitoring of \nparameters such as turbidity, color, and contamination indicators without \nthe need for manual sampling or chemical reagents. \n●​ Such an approach could improve monitoring efficiency, reduce operational \ncosts, and provide earlier detection of water quality changes or pollution \nevents in wastewater treatment plants. \n●​ Such systems were already tested and demonstrated effectiveness in \ncapturing relevant water quality metrics under varying \noperational conditions. \n \n2.​ Earth orbiting satellites e.g.  Sentinel-2, Landsat                              \n●​ Sentinel-2 offers a spatial resolution of up to 10 meters for its \nvisible and near-infrared bands, which is considered high resolution in \nsatellite remote sensing. This resolution is sufficient to observe water \nsurface properties in medium to large rivers like the Rhône in Switzerland's \nValais. It allows detection of turbidity, chlorophyll, suspended sediments, \nand algal blooms over the river surface, especially in wider sections \n●​ Landsat 8 provides a spatial resolution of 30 meters for its multispectral \nbands. While useful for regional watershed monitoring and large water \nbodies, 30m resolution is typically coarser than Sentinel-2 and less \noptimal for detailed analysis of narrow river segments but still can capture \nmajor changes in water quality and sediment plumes at the Rhône River \nscale. \n●​ Use satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat) to monitor surface water \nparameters such as turbidity, chlorophyll, suspended sediments, and algal \nblooms. \n●​ These satellites have spectral bands sensitive to water quality indicators \nand can provide data over large spatial scales. \n●​ Data can be processed with specialized algorithms or custom tools to \nestimate water quality parameters \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA wide range of autonomous, multiparameter water quality sondes are available on the \nmarket for continuous data logging. These sensors are rugged, easy to deploy, and offer \nwireless data transmission—ideal for field and long-term river monitoring. Below are \nleading devices and brands widely used for professional water quality assessment: \n1. In-Situ Aqua TROLL Series \n●​ Models: Aqua TROLL 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800. \n●​ Features: Fully customizable, rugged sondes with capacities for multiple \ninterchangeable sensors (pH, ORP, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, temperature, \nand more), antifouling options, Bluetooth connectivity for the VuSitu mobile app, and \ntelemetry options for remote real-time data access and storage. \n●​ Suitable for: Spot checks, continuous unattended deployment, both short- and long-term \nmonitoring. \n●​ Wireless/Data: Real-time remote monitoring possible with VuLink telemetry or Wireless \nTROLL Com. \n2. YSI EXO Series (Xylem) \n●​ Models: EXO1, EXO2, EXO3, EXO3s. \n●​ Features: Customizable with multiple smart sensors, anti-fouling technology, Bluetooth \nconnectivity, and compatibility with KorEXO and other wireless/data management \nsoftware. \n●​ Suitable for: Long-term unattended deployments in fresh and marine environments. \n●​ Wireless/Data: Bluetooth and telemetry options available. \n3. Hydrolab HL Series (OTT HydroMet) \n●​ Models: HL4, HL7. \n●​ Features: Modular, rugged sondes for both spot and continuous monitoring, including \nSDI-12 and RS-485 communication, support for multiple parameters and anti-fouling. \n●​ Suitable for: Long unattended deployments; trusted for environmental, regulatory, and \nresearch use. \n4. Solinst Eureka Manta+ Sondes \n●​ Models: Manta+25, Manta+30, Manta+35, Manta F35, Manta+40. \n●​ Features: Highly customizable (up to 11 sensors), compact/rugged, ideal for diverse \nenvironments, anti-fouling options, and advanced sensor technology for accuracy and \nreliability. \n●​ Suitable for: Both spot sampling and long-term unattended deployments. \n \n \nRemote sensing of water quality in the Rhône River, has been integrated into several \nmonitoring and research projects with promising results: \n●​ The Rhône Sediment Observatory (OSR) has operated since around 2009 a \nnetwork of monitoring stations on the Rhône and its tributaries. Although \nprimarily in-situ based, it integrates turbidity sensors and suspended particulate \nmatter (SPM) data that can be remotely sensed or linked with satellite imagery to \nstudy sediment fluxes, contaminant concentrations, and their variations during \nevents like floods. \n●​ The AlpineWELLS project in Switzerland has included remote sensing methods \nalong with in-situ sensors for water quality monitoring on glacier-fed lakes and \nalpine water bodies, including parts of the Rhône basin. They employ satellite \ndata (e.g., Sentinel-2) and ground reference measurements to track turbidity, \ntemperature, and algal signals relevant to water quality. \n●​ Research has explored the use of satellite Earth Observation data combined with \nhydrodynamic and water quality models to evaluate the spatial and temporal \ndistribution of water quality parameters along the Rhône River and its plume \nreaching Lake Geneva. Sentinel-2 imagery has been shown useful for mapping \nturbidity and suspended sediments in this context. \n \nHere are some project name ideas: \n1.​ AquaGuard Industry Monitor \n2.​ AQUAMIND - Autonomous QUAlity Monitoring with INtegrated Data \n3.​ RHEONET -Rhône Hybrid Environmental Observation NETwork \n4.​ Turbisense: Industrial Water Analytics \n5.​ Smart Rhoene River Quality Platform \n6.​ ClearView: Industrial Water Insight \n7.​ FlowSecure: Industrial Turbidity Monitoring \n8.​ HydroVue: Industrial Water Monitoring \n \n",

        "content": "Title: Autonomous and Continuous Water Quality Monitoring\n\nOur goal is to deliver reliable and timely water quality data,  by deploying autonomous sensors, such as multiparameter sondes, we can continuously monitor key water parameters with efficiency and precision. Our hybrid approaches also combining satellite remote sensing, and continuous autonomous in-situ sensors with wireless telemetry provides the best solution to remotely monitor water quality in the Rhône river. This approach leverages the strengths of each method to achieve spatial coverage, temporal frequency, and detailed water quality parameter measurement.\n\nIn-situ sensors required properties:                                   \nComprehensive Measurements: Multiparameter sondes should track essential indicators like pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, and temperature simultaneously, providing a full picture of water quality.\nContinuous, Autonomous Logging: These devices should operate autonomously after deployment, logging measurements around the clock with minimal need for manual intervention.\nRugged Design: Built for the outdoors, these sensors should be designed to withstand harsh river conditions and guarantee reliable performance over extended periods.\nEasy Setup & Field Deployment\nWireless Data Transmission\n\nRemote sensing and monitoring of the water quality \nGround based monitoring system   - an intelligent vision system to monitor water quality without direct contact.\nVisual Monitoring: Fixed cameras positioned overlooking rivers or lakes capture time-lapse or live images showing water color, surface turbidity, sediment plumes, algal blooms, and floating debris. Changes in these visual cues can indicate shifts in water quality.\nA system with multispectral imaging technology combined with artificial intelligence to analyze optical characteristics of water quality indicators from the spectral data.\nThis non-contact method allows for continuous, real-time monitoring of parameters such as turbidity, color, and contamination indicators without the need for manual sampling or chemical reagents.\nSuch an approach could improve monitoring efficiency, reduce operational costs, and provide earlier detection of water quality changes or pollution events in wastewater treatment plants.\nSuch systems were already tested and demonstrated effectiveness in capturing relevant water quality metrics under varying operational conditions.\n\nEarth orbiting satellites e.g.  Sentinel-2, Landsat                             \nSentinel-2 offers a spatial resolution of up to 10 meters for its visible and near-infrared bands, which is considered high resolution in satellite remote sensing. This resolution is sufficient to observe water surface properties in medium to large rivers like the Rhône in Switzerland's Valais. It allows detection of turbidity, chlorophyll, suspended sediments, and algal blooms over the river surface, especially in wider sections\nLandsat 8 provides a spatial resolution of 30 meters for its multispectral bands. While useful for regional watershed monitoring and large water bodies, 30m resolution is typically coarser than Sentinel-2 and less optimal for detailed analysis of narrow river segments but still can capture major changes in water quality and sediment plumes at the Rhône River scale.\nUse satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2, Landsat) to monitor surface water parameters such as turbidity, chlorophyll, suspended sediments, and algal blooms.\nThese satellites have spectral bands sensitive to water quality indicators and can provide data over large spatial scales.\nData can be processed with specialized algorithms or custom tools to estimate water quality parameters\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix:\n\nMy prove of concept with Sentinel-2 data to analyse turbidity of Rhoene river:\nhttps://research-git.ffhs.ch/ffhs-lws/water.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wide range of autonomous, multiparameter water quality sondes are available on the market for continuous data logging. These sensors are rugged, easy to deploy, and offer wireless data transmission—ideal for field and long-term river monitoring. Below are leading devices and brands widely used for professional water quality assessment:\n1. In-Situ Aqua TROLL Series\nModels: Aqua TROLL 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800.\nFeatures: Fully customizable, rugged sondes with capacities for multiple interchangeable sensors (pH, ORP, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, temperature, and more), antifouling options, Bluetooth connectivity for the VuSitu mobile app, and telemetry options for remote real-time data access and storage.\nSuitable for: Spot checks, continuous unattended deployment, both short- and long-term monitoring.\nWireless/Data: Real-time remote monitoring possible with VuLink telemetry or Wireless TROLL Com.\n2. YSI EXO Series (Xylem)\nModels: EXO1, EXO2, EXO3, EXO3s.\nFeatures: Customizable with multiple smart sensors, anti-fouling technology, Bluetooth connectivity, and compatibility with KorEXO and other wireless/data management software.\nSuitable for: Long-term unattended deployments in fresh and marine environments.\nWireless/Data: Bluetooth and telemetry options available.\n3. Hydrolab HL Series (OTT HydroMet)\nModels: HL4, HL7.\nFeatures: Modular, rugged sondes for both spot and continuous monitoring, including SDI-12 and RS-485 communication, support for multiple parameters and anti-fouling.\nSuitable for: Long unattended deployments; trusted for environmental, regulatory, and research use.\n4. Solinst Eureka Manta+ Sondes\nModels: Manta+25, Manta+30, Manta+35, Manta F35, Manta+40.\nFeatures: Highly customizable (up to 11 sensors), compact/rugged, ideal for diverse environments, anti-fouling options, and advanced sensor technology for accuracy and reliability.\nSuitable for: Both spot sampling and long-term unattended deployments.\n\n\nRemote sensing of water quality in the Rhône River, has been integrated into several monitoring and research projects with promising results:\nThe Rhône Sediment Observatory (OSR) has operated since around 2009 a network of monitoring stations on the Rhône and its tributaries. Although primarily in-situ based, it integrates turbidity sensors and suspended particulate matter (SPM) data that can be remotely sensed or linked with satellite imagery to study sediment fluxes, contaminant concentrations, and their variations during events like floods.\nThe AlpineWELLS project in Switzerland has included remote sensing methods along with in-situ sensors for water quality monitoring on glacier-fed lakes and alpine water bodies, including parts of the Rhône basin. They employ satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2) and ground reference measurements to track turbidity, temperature, and algal signals relevant to water quality.\nResearch has explored the use of satellite Earth Observation data combined with hydrodynamic and water quality models to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of water quality parameters along the Rhône River and its plume reaching Lake Geneva. Sentinel-2 imagery has been shown useful for mapping turbidity and suspended sediments in this context.\n\nHere are some project name ideas:\nAQUAMIND - Autonomous QUAlity Monitoring with INtegrated Data\nAquaGuard Industry Monitor\nRHEONET -Rhône Hybrid Environmental Observation NETwork\nTurbisense: Industrial Water Analytics\nSmart Rhoene River Quality Platform\nClearView: Industrial Water Insight\nFlowSecure: Industrial Turbidity Monitoring\nHydroVue: Industrial Water Monitoring\n\n",

Following the scientific findings published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, Switzerland has announced in August 2019 its ambitious target to reduce its net carbon emis-\nsions to zero by 2050 \"[…] through technologies that are already available and by using renewable \nenergy sources”. Among renewable sources, photovoltaic energy is crucial in order to reach this goal, \nboth in terms of cost competitive price, of energy market penetration in the last years and of potential \navailable on roofs and façades in Switzerland (67 TWh/year, source BFE 2019). The explosive trend \nin price reduction of this technology has been possible thanks to a mix of constant improvement in cell \nefficiency, industrial optimization and economies of scale, but important steps in terms of lifetime en-\nhancement are needed in order to grant the lowest Levelized Cost Of Electricity (LCOE). Even more \nimportantly, as discussed by S-Ovaitt et al.2 “[…] reliability and circular pathways represent the best \nopportunities to reduce waste by 56% while maintaining installed capacity. Shorter-lived modules gen-\nerate 81% more waste and reduce 2050 capacity by 6%”.  \nThe aim of this project is to define a new methodology for the quantitative and prompt analysis of \ndefects and failures in PV modules through image analysis in combination with the use of artificial \nintelligence algorithms and their correlation to module performance losses. The use of a unique ex-\ntremely high-resolution multi-spectral camera with sensitivity from UV to IR, appropriate filters and light \nsetup, and a single shot for each defective PV module, will allow to speed up the acquisition phase to \nreasonable timings, avoiding uncertainties related to errors for multiple shots with different cameras \nand keeping the strength of combining different diagnostic tools needed for an efficient evaluation of \nsingle defects. To achieve the project goals, a methodology for the automatic identification of failure \nmodes at cell level will be implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The algorithm \nwill be trained on the natural aged cells of the TISO plant then, in order to shift the picture to current \ntechnologies, multiple sets of recent modules with naturally aged defects on the field will be evaluated \nwith the same criteria. The machine learning algorithms will be applied and evaluated in terms of ca-\npability to detect the relevant failure modes of TISO and new ones, typical of the new cell/module \ntechnologies. The results of the project will have a direct impact on the future methodology to trace \ndefects, both in research laboratories and in production environment, allowing a quantitative and meas-\nurable way to record the evolution of module performances. A preliminary activity has been carried out \nwith the low-resolution electroluminescence (EL) images of the TISO modules. These images have \nbeen automatically segmented to analyse each cell. Convolutional layers have been used for extracting \nrelevant features from the EL images and a semi-supervised strategy has provided promising results \nin recognizing good from damaged cells after only labelling 2% of the available images manually (Fig. \n1a). Convolutional autoencoders also achieved a good separation between damaged and good cells \nboth after training on the limited labelled TISO data (2% of the available low-resolution images) and on \npublicly available labelled datasets3, proving that the use of convolutional neural networks is a good \nchoice for this project (Fig. 1b). The innovative approach of using of high-resolution multispectral im-\nages will allow not only to separate good from damaged cells, but to identify different kinds of failures \nas well. \n \n \n2 S.

What are the best settings to optimise signal-to-noise ratio? \n• Which model based on convolutional neural networks achieves the better accuracy in identifying \nfailure modes in crystalline silicon solar cells? \n \n \n7/18 \n \n \n• What is the contribution of the different channels into identifying the failure modes? \n• What is the relevant importance of the different failure modes in the degradation of the performance \nof the modules? How does this change in the different technologies? \n \nThe achievement of the project goals paves the way for the adoption of the developed techniques in \nindustrial settings for newly produced modules and in degradation studies of PV modules based on \ntechnologies other than crystalline silicon. \n \n3. \nDetailed project description (maximum 5 pages) \nDescribe in detail the project approach, dividing it into work packages. Define the designated work steps, \nthe followed methodology and – for SSH projects4 – the data employed as well as the activities that will \narise throughout the project. Complete the description by adding suitable illustrations, such as images, \nsketches, diagrams, plans, etc. For SSH: Show how access to the data required is secure and how the \ndata compilation strategy is clearly defined. \nWP1: Project management \nThe aims of this WP are the coordination and organisation of the activities of the project, the monitoring \nof the progress of the project, risk management and reporting. Two project meetings per year will be \norganised and online meeting will be held regularly in order to keep track of the project. \n \nDeliverables: financial and scientific reports. \n \nWP2: Instrument setup, calibration and data acquisition \n2.1. Procurement of instrumentation, setup and calibration  \nThe first activity will be the analysis of the instrumentation necessary for the acquisition of multispectral \nimages. The choice of an industrial level medium format camera with the highest native resolution \navailable on the market allows for the best flexibility in terms of data acquisition and detail. This shall \nbe matched with a proper lens in order to avoid bottlenecks from the optical point of view, like the need \nof merging more pictures to have the complete module surface. The PhaseOne/Linos camera, already \nverified in the preliminary tests, is a good starting point for this activity if combined with the right lens. \nThe instrumentation setup will be organised in such a way to proceed with the highest repeatability \nand colour reproduction, through the adoption of calibration points. \n We foresee the following elements:  \n• Phase one iXM MV150f 150 Mpixel multi-spectral camera (to be procured);  \n• high resolution wide lens with UV, IR, visible even transmittance (to be procured);  \n• a motorized solution for changing the filters on a rotating wheel (to be procured);  \n• two LED lamps for the visible light, mounted at a 45° angle to avoid glass reflections (to be procured); \n• two UV LED lamps for the photoluminescence UV, mounted at a 45° angle to avoid glass reflections \n(to be procured);  \n• a power supply to trigger the electroluminescence effect in the modules (to be procured);  \n• colour reference target for the correct determination of the colour space (available).  \nThe setup used in the feasibility study for the tests depicted in Fig. 3 is a good starting base. \n \n4 Projects of the SFOE research programme «Social Sciences and Humanities». \n \n8/18 \n \n \n \nFigure 3: instruments setup used for the preliminary data acquisition (photo SUPSI). \n \nThe calibration phase will be crucial to ensure that the signals coming from different modules are ac-\nquired in the same color range. \n \n2.2 Logistics, preparation and image acquisition \nDifferent sets of modules with defects caused by long term outdoor exposure will be analysed in order \nto have a comprehensive approach, including various cell technologies. One set of modules with IBC \ncells, part of a walkable plant mounted on the first solar catamaran from 2010 to 2015, is available for \nfurther analysis. Another big set, available at SUPSI, is the one of the TISO PV plant, with 240 modules \nnaturally aged for 35 years. Possible further sets are in consideration, in relation to running projects on \nreliability at SUPSI and thanks to the partnerships with different PV-installers. \nThe modules will be cleaned and labelled in order to use barcode reader to grant fast traceability. The \naim of the activity is to acquire 5 high-resolution pictures for each module (red, green and blue images \nfor visible, IR electroluminescence and UV photoluminescence) and to combine them into one multi-\nspectral image. The use of these images to train the AI algorithm will allow to identify more easily the \ncell failures thanks to the different defects that each channel is targeting: UV light for delamination, \nvisible light for browning and IR light for hotspot are some examples of the possible differentiations. \nSome of the defects, e.g. hot spots, benefit from a wider response, with different patterns in different \nwavelengths, making their detection through multispectral imaging much powerful than the standard \napproach of electroluminescence. \n \n2.3 Electrical measurements of the modules’ performances \nThe modules’ performances will be evaluated in terms of maximum power (Pmax), short circuit current \n(Isc) and fill factor (FF) by using a flasher simulator. The measurements of the TISO modules are al-\nready available, thus limiting this activity to new technologies. \n \nDeliverables: calibrated data acquisition system, raw data-set. \n \nWP3: Accelerated testing of new technologies \n3.1 Definition of module technologies \nA set of modules with artificially triggered failures will be accelerated and documented with the same \napproach followed for naturally aged modules in order to build a dataset of documented failures for \nmore recent monocrystalline technologies. This will allow to verify the generalization capabilities of the \nartificial intelligence algorithms for the automatic classification of failure modes developed in WP5. \nThe definition of module technologies to be investigated will be the first step, in order to do a preliminary \nevaluation of best matches of the algorithm: mono-BSF or mono-PERC modules, half cut or bifacial \nlayouts and shingled cells modules will be investigated, triggering failures through direct damage and \nanalysing the algorithm behaviour on a limited number of cells.  \n \n3.1 Accelerated testing and acquisition of multispectral images \nBased on the results of activity 3.2, the procurement of three representative sets of modules will be \npursued, in order to proceed with the testing activities and AI analysis of the data of the of the data set \nextended to new technologies. The naturally aged modules have a long data record of not accelerated \n \n \n9/18 \n \n \naging but are limited by the older technology behind them: once the AI algorithm has been trained \ncorrectly, the power of the method is to extend the concept to the new modules. The acceleration of \ntheir aging and interpretation of the images can forecast the degradation mechanisms in shorter tim-\nings, going beyond the state of the art. \n \nDeliverables: raw data-set of new technologies. \n \nWP4 Data pre-processing and image annotation \n4.1 Pre-processing of multispectral images \nThe multispectral images of the solar modules need to be pre-processed in order to be used as an \ninput of machine learning models. A pre-processing routine will be developed comprising: \n• Combination of the images taken in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum into one multi-\nspectral image with 5 channels. \n• Colour/contrast correction of the images also through the use of colour checker during the calibration \nphase. \n• Segmentation of the images of the modules into single cells with the same pixel size. \n \n4.2 Annotation of multispectral images \nIn order to automatically identify failure modes, a first dataset containing labelled multispectral images \nis needed. For each multispectral image of a single cell, two independent operators will annotate which \nfailure modes are present and with which severity using the same standards employed in5,6 (Fig. 4). In \ncase of disagreement, a third operator will cast a deciding vote. The same annotation frame will be \nused for different PV technologies and will be employed also after the end of the present project. The \nmethodology developed within the project will allow for transferring the trained system to new technol-\nogies with limited amount of new labelled images (transfer learning). \n \n \nFigure 4: Schematic representation of image pre-processing and annotation. \n \n4.3 Development of an annotation frame \nAn annotation frame is needed in order to carry out the activity 4.2 both on naturally and artificially \naged modules. Moreover, it will enable the application of the developed methodologies beyond the \npresent project. The same frame will be developed further for the visualisation of the results of WP5 \n(5.1 Identification of failure modes and 5.2 Module statistics and performance). \n \nDeliverables: annotated dataset of multispectral images, annotation frame. \n \nWP5: Data analysis and modelling \n5.1 Identification of failure modes. \nThe annotated multispectral images will be employed for the training of a system based on CNNs for \nthe classification tasks of assigning one or more failure modes to each cell. The failure modes with the \nhighest probability will be taken into consideration in a first step (semi-automatic classification) and a \ncut-off probability threshold will be optimized during the project for a fully automatic classification of the \nfailure modes. Thanks to the developed methodology, the identification of failures will be not only much \nfaster compared to the actual standard (10 minutes per module and operator vs. seconds) but will also \nbe more robust to operator subjectivity. The system will be extended to technologies other than the \n \n5 Virtuani, A. et al. 35 Years of Photovoltaics: Analysis of the TISO‐10‐kW Solar Plant, Lessons Learnt in Safety and Perfor-\nmance—Part 1.

A dataset containing the ratio of cells pro module affected by each failure mode as well as the \nperformance of the module performance in terms of maximum power (Pmax), short circuit current (Isc) \nand fill factor (FF) will be generated. A pipeline will be developed, which combines the pre-processing \n(task 3.1) and the identification of the failure modes (task 4.1), so that the failure mode statistics can \nbe directly obtained after capturing a multispectral image of a module (Fig. 5). \n \n \nFigure 5: Automatic failure mode identification and generation of module statistic. \n \n5.3 Contribution of failure modes to the module performance \nStarting from the ratio of cells pro module affected by each failure mode different machine learning \nalgorithms will be trained to predict the module performance (Pmax, Isc and FF). Different machine learn-\ning models such as Random Forest and standard neural networks will be compared. Once the models \nhave been trained and tested on a held-out portion of the dataset, a feature importance analysis will \nbe carried out to investigate the effect of each failure mode on the performance (Fig. 6). In addition to \nthe available tools for the intrinsic interpretable models (e.g. magnitude of the model coefficients in \nlinear models), permutation feature importance will be carried out. This is a model-independent tech-\nnique that consists in shuffling the values of one feature and measuring the increase in the error of the \nmodel predictions. Comparing the results of the different models, the failure modes with the strongest \nimpact for the degradation of the modules will be identified. The same procedure can be applied to \ndifferent PV technologies in order to investigate if different failure modes have different importance in \nthe different technologies and to which degree. \n \n \nFigure 6: Analysis of the impact of the different failure modes on module performance. \n \nDeliverables: algorithm prototypes (source code), data analysis report. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11/18 \n \n \n4. \nSchedule \nIllustrate the schedule for carrying out the project in a diagram (e.g., as a table or a GANTT chart). \nDefine the content, the chronological order (dates for the start and end), the milestones to be attained \nand the deliverables of each activity and/or work package: \nDeliverables: \nWP1: financial and scientific reports (text documents). \nWP2: calibrated data acquisition system (equipment), raw data-set of multispectral images. \nWP3: raw data-set of multispectral images of new technologies. \nWP4: annotated dataset of multispectral images (images, text documents), annotation frame (software). \nWP5: algorithm prototypes (source code), data analysis report (text document). \n \n5. \nDissemination / Accompanying measures (knowledge and technology transfer) \nDescribe how the results/solutions/experience gained from the project will be processed and commu-\nnicated to potential recipients from the economy, society, politics, etc. (e.g., through communication, \npublications, lectures, protection of intellectual property, exchange of experience monitoring groups). \nFor research projects: describe the open access/ data / model strategy. \nDifferent type of data will be collected during the project. Images coming from visual inspection (RGB, \nvisible range), electroluminescence (grayscale, infrared range), photoluminescence (grayscale, ultra-\nviolet range) will be collected for each photovoltaic module. The images will be archived in the DNG \nformat (Digital Negative). This format is more convenient than the RAW format, which is different for \neach camera model and not openly documented. DNG on the other hand relies on open specifications7. \nMoreover, current-voltage (I-V) curves for each module will be collected and saved as CSV files. Ver-\nsioning will be managed using Git, which is a version-control system that supports non-linear project \ndevelopment and allows different researchers to work collaboratively on the same project.  \nThe data will be released with an open license on Zenodo. Thanks to the rich metadata structure of \nZenodo, the dataset will be easy to find. Moreover, dissemination of the scientific results in the form of \nscientific publication (e.g. journal articles, conference proceedings) and conference presentations will \nalso increase the visibility of the data. The DOI of the datasets will be included in such publications \nand also the DOIs of such related publications can be integrated in the metadata of the datasets. \nThe release of open datasets helps scientists to achieve a higher quality of their scientific results, \nreducing duplicated efforts and promoting transparency and collaboration8. The release of the datasets \nproduced with the present project to the scientific community with an open license will facilitate further \nresearch in this field. \nStudents will be involved with the topics investigated in the project both through the lectures available \nat BSc and continuing education level and through BSc and MSc thesis.

(For research \nprojects: Does the project contribute to a priority of the SFOE energy research concept and is it part of \nnational or international cooperation?) \nThe project contributes directly or indirectly to the following 3 research priorities of the SFOE: \n- Further reduction of costs throughout the entire supply chain: increasing the efficiency of single com-\nponents, industrial implementation of new products and manufacturing procedures, quality assurance, \nincreasing plant reliability. \n- Further development and industrial implementation of various types of solar cell technology, such as \nsilicon-based heterojunction solar cells, CIGS thin-film solar cells, and tandem cell concepts for a high \ndegree of efficiency. \n- Quality assurance and reliability studies for inverters and modules. \nThe project is a national cooperation between two institutes belonging to two universities of applied \nscience (FFHS and SUPSI). The interdisciplinary nature of this cooperation is of great strategic im-\nportance, as it combines the experience of the PVLab in the field of photovoltaic reliability and the in-\ndepth knowledge of the LWS in the field of applied artificial intelligence. \nThis project is part of a constellation of projects and proposals on PV-reliability which also include early \nidentification of failures. This will allow a fruitful exchange of information, methodologies and hardware \n(e.g. modules of different technologies). PV-Detect (Solar ERA-NET project SI/502484-01) is the first \nfinanced project in this long-term strategy. \n \n2. \nPotential for implementation and multiplication \nDescribe the potential for implementation in Switzerland and worldwide of the technology/solution/pro-\ncess to be studied. Estimate the market prospects of a later product/service and describe how and by \nwhom the future implementation of the knowledge gained will occur. Name existing competitors and \nsolutions (optional for SSH projects). \n \n \n13/18 \n \n \nMulti-spectral imaging has a wide set of uses, from investigation of works of art and documents to \nweather forecasting, but for the moment has not been used for preventive failure detection on PV \nmodules through artificial Intelligence. The project aims to validate the methodology in controlled envi-\nronment as a first step to extend it to on site analysis. The potential in terms of investigation of PV \nmodules installed on buildings is enormous, both in terms of preventive failure that in in terms of pop-\nulation of digital twins: the use of drones with high resolution payloads can allow to gather enough \ninformation to detect properly emerging problems and to apply the correct maintenance. Safety of the \nPV system will be monitored and the energy production optimized. In addition, traceability will be \ngranted in different phases of the installation and of the life of the building, monitoring eventual prob-\nlems and giving the opportunity to solve them in shorter times.  \nMoreover, climate change is introducing harsher meteorological events in the Alpine region, like hail-\nstorms with larger hailstones. For this reason, the analysis through high resolution multi-spectral im-\nages will allow to detect damages, evaluate them quantitatively and give criteria for the replacement \nof dangerously damaged modules. \n \n3. \nEnergy potential \nQuantify the anticipated energetic benefit that will result from this project (or technology/solution/pro-\ncess), by estimating the anticipated production of renewable energy, the anticipated energy savings or \nany other benefit (economic, political, etc.) derived for the energy system for a single undertaking as \nwell as the total potential through the multiplication of the undertaking. Compare the energy balance of \nthe examined system with the current state of technology/knowledge. For SSH projects: Evaluate the \ncontribution to a safe, sustainable and economic energy supply as well as to an economical and rational \nenergy consumption. \nWe propose to start the activities on the early automatic detection of failures on PV modules at lab \nlevel, in a well-controlled environment, to shift them in the future to on field examination. The develop-\nment of a multi-spectral analysis based on artificial intelligence will allow to ensure the quality of new \nmodules before installation, thus avoiding power losses due to the evolution of hidden failures during \nthe years. \nA further development beyond the end of this project is the application of the methodologies in Oper-\nation & Maintenance (O&M). IR analysis is already used in this field for large PV plants, where low-\nresolution cameras mounted on drones can give information on suspected hot spots. However, the \nextension to multi-spectral high-resolution cameras can be particularly useful not only for this kind of \nsystems, but also for built environments, where PV modules are subject to more critical environmental \nconditions. \n \n4. \nProject environment / Innovation / Added value \nMake a list of current undertakings and existing solutions (national and international) and describe what \ndistinguishes this project favourably from these, where the innovative aspects lie in terms of the current \nstate of knowledge and what fundamentally new knowledge can be generated by the project. Describe \nwhich technical and/or scientific advantages will result from the new technology/solution/process and to \nwhat extent new knowledge, know-how and value creation can be generated. \n \n14/18 \n \n \nThe research of the optimal acceleration to detect failures at the earliest possible time is pursued by \nthe IEC technical committees, who are now working on a revision of the IEC 61215 and 61730 stand-\nards much faster than the previous updates, to cover new defects coming from new technologies. The \nsolar industry is looking as well for new formulas to grant defect free production and increase the \nwarranty terms. E.g. from 1st January 2022 Sunpower is offering 40-years warranty at product and \nperformance level, guaranteeing 88.3% power output at end-of-life. \nEven though the accelerated testing sequences can simulate well the different stresses experienced \nby solar modules on the field, the extremely difficult part is the extrapolation to real life situations and \nthe extension of the results to a far future, reason for which the analysis of field data is crucial9. The \ncombination of different stress factors like UV, temperature, humidity, electrochemical effects, is not \nlinear and does not super-impose easily. The employment of multiple simultaneous factors for testing \na statistically significant number of modules is too expensive for the industry, even more when we \nconsider the continuous changing of the production technology and the consequent update of qualifi-\ncation certificates. The new layouts and concepts subjected to standard and accelerated testing are \nshowing some critical patterns, for example for hotspot sensitivity on bifacial10 and shingled cells11. On \nthe other hand, even though the installed systems with high-efficiency modules are relatively young, \ntheir rate of degradation is strongly related to cell degradation which can be thoroughly investigated \nalso through electroluminescence and photoluminescence12.  \nFor all of the above reasons, the opportunity to use high-resolution images on different bandwidths \n(visible, UV, IR) to identify and quantify the appearance of failure modes, as proposed in the present \nproject, represents a very promising way to monitor and compare the accelerated and/or not acceler-\nated degradation of PV modules. The failure modes will be automatically identified and classified by \nmeans of machine learning algorithms. Artificial intelligence algorithms have been used to successfully \nsolve the task of classifying images in different application fields and Convolutional Neural Networks \n(CNN) have been proved to achieve very good performance13. An additional advantage of CNNs is \ntheir transfer learning capability, meaning that CNNs which are trained for another image related task, \ni.e. already learned certain patterns, can be used and adjusted to the problem at hand, which can \nreduce training time significantly14. Once deployed, the algorithms allow to automatically identify the \nobjects in new data not yet seen by the model. \nIn the field of failure modes classification in photovoltaics, machine learning has been employed mainly \nfor the analysis of electroluminescence (EL) images15,16. In these studies only one failure was consid-\nered for each cell, a limitation for PV modules aged in real settings. Our approach aims at going beyond \nthe state of the art by developing a methodology for the automatic identification of failure modes using \nmultispectral images (visible, EL, PL). The employment of data coming from more than one experi-\nmental technique allows for the identification of a wider spectrum of degradation modes, which is par-\n \n9 Jordan, D. C.; Kurtz, S.

Moreover, the identification \nof more than one degradation mode in one solar cell will be enabled, making a quantitative analysis of \nthe impact of the different failure modes on the module performance possible. The developed method-\nology will also reduce the subjectivity that affects the manual annotation of failure modes17. In this \nstudy, two different operators identified an average 1.4 and 2.8 defects per PV module, respectively. \nIn our approach, care will be taken in the annotation of the training dataset (see Activity 3.2 in WP3). \nAfterwards, the deployment of the trained model will enable a quantitative comparison of data coming \nfrom different modules measured at different times. The approach presented in our project is easily \nscalable while providing quantitative insights on the degradation mechanisms of PV modules. \n \n5. \nSustainability \nIndicate to what extent this project supports the federal Sustainability Development Strategy in the di-\nmensions of society, economy and environment on the national and the global plane. \nThe recognition of defects at an early stage allows increased confidence in the reliability and long-term \nbehaviour of PV modules ensuring that “the expanded use of renewable energy sources in Switzerland \n[will] be compatible with the protection of biological and landscape diversity and bodies of water and \nat the same time affordable”18. As illustrated by S.Ovaitt et al, 2022 “Increasing module lifetime through \nimproved reliability has the biggest effect on life cycle waste. A 10% improvement in module lifetime \nand reliability results in a 53% decrease in life cycle waste.”2 \n \n \n6. \nSafety risks \nExplain the risks to people and the environment that may arise through the project or through imple-\nmentation of the corresponding technology/processes, and state which measures are planned to min-\nimise such risks. \nNo safety risks are envisaged, both for persons and environment. All the pictures will be taken and \ntreated in digital form, no dangerous substances are used to treat or clean PV modules. \nCare shall be taken in handling the modules and biasing them with a power supply for taking electro-\nluminescence pictures. The procedures set in the ISO 17025 accredited SUPSI PVLab will be followed \nand eventually improved in order to cover unforeseen safety aspects. \n \n7. \nFurther federal contributions \nHas (or will) an inquiry or an official application for further financial contributions been made to another \nfederal funding institution (Innosuisse, SNSF, FOEN, FOT, FEDRO, SwissEnergy, etc.) for the current \nproject or a related project?  \n☐ Yes \n☒ No \n \nIf so, give the date of submission, the name of the funding institution and the decision and/or evaluation \nreceived. \nClick here to enter text. \n \n \n \n17 Hamzavy, B.

However, its application in certain imaging fields,\nsuch as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges. In these\ndomains, images often contain multiple channels, each carrying semantically dis-\ntinct and independent information. Furthermore, the model must demonstrate ro-\nbustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available during\ntraining or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT architec-\nture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce Hierarchical\nChannel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique to ensure ro-\nbustness when only partial channels are presented during test time. Our proposed\nmodel, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each input chan-\nnel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the patch tokens,\nsimilar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of ChannelViT\non ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat (satellite imag-\ning). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on classification tasks\nand generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels is used during testing.\nAcross our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful regularizer, independent\nof the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a straightforward technique for\nrobust ViT training. Lastly, we find that ChannelViT generalizes effectively even\nwhen there is limited access to all channels during training, highlighting its po-\ntential for multi-channel imaging under real-world conditions with sparse sensors.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/insitro/ChannelViT.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nVision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as a crucial architecture in contemporary computer vision,\nsignificantly enhancing image analysis. However, application to specific imaging domains, such as\nmicroscopy and satellite imaging, poses unique challenges. Images in these fields often comprise\nmultiple channels, each carrying semantically distinct and independent information. The complexity\nis further compounded by the fact that these input channels may not always be densely available\nduring training or testing, necessitating a model capable of handling such sparsity.\nIn response to these challenges, we propose a modification to the ViT architecture that bolsters\nreasoning across the input channels. Our proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens in-\ndependently from each input channel and incorporates a learnable channel embedding that is added\nto the patch tokens in addition to the location-specific positional embedding. This simple modifica-\ntion enables the model to reason across both locations and channels.

The input for ChannelViT is\na cell image from JUMP-CP, which comprises five fluorescence channels (colored differently) and\nthree brightfield channels (colored in B&W). ChannelViT generates patch tokens for each individual\nchannel, utilizing a learnable channel embedding chn to preserve channel-specific information. The\npositional embeddings pos and the linear projection W are shared across all channels.\nchannel dimension as the patch sequence dimension, ChannelViT can seamlessly handle inputs with\nvarying sets of channels.\nDespite these advancements, two main challenges persist. While ChannelViT can leverage existing\nefficient implementations of ViT with minimal modifications, the increase in sequence length intro-\nduces additional computational requirements. Moreover, if ChannelViT is consistently trained on\nthe same set of channels, its ability to generalize to unseen channel combinations at test time may be\ncompromised. To address these challenges, we introduce Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS), a\nnew regularization technique designed to improve robustness. Unlike channel dropout, which drops\nout each input channel independently, HCS uses a two-step sampling procedure. It first samples the\nnumber of channels and then, based on this, it samples the specific channel configurations. While\nchannel dropout tends to allocate more distribution to combinations with a specific number of chan-\nnels, HCS assigns a uniform weight to the selection of any number of channels. HCS consistently\nimproves robustness when different channels are utilized during testing in both ViT and ChannelViT.\nNotably, our evaluation on ImageNet shows that using only the red channel, HCS can increase the\nvalidation accuracy from 29.39 to 68.86.\nWe further evaluate ChannelViT on two real world multi-channel imaging applications: microscopy\ncell imaging (JUMP-CP) and satellite imaging (So2Sat). In these applications, different channels\noften correspond to independent information sources. ChannelViT significantly outperforms its ViT\ncounterpart in these datasets, underscoring the importance of reasoning across different channels.\nMoreover, by treating different channels as distinct input tokens, we demonstrate that ChannelViT\ncan effectively generalize even when there is limited access to all channels in the dataset during train-\ning. Lastly, we show that ChannelViT enables additional insights. The learned channel embeddings\ncorrespond to meaningful interpretations, and the attention visualization highlights relevant features\nacross spatial and spectral resolution, enhancing interpretability. This highlights the potential of\nChannelViT for wide-ranging applications in the field of multi-channel imaging.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nVision transformer and its applications to multi-channel imaging\nVision Transformer (ViT)\nhas demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks Dosovitskiy et al.;\nTouvron et al. (2021); Carion et al. (2020); Zhu et al. (2020b). Recently, researchers have started\nadopting ViT for multi-spectral imaging. For example, in satellite imaging, Kaselimi et al. (2022)\nshowed that a ViT-based classifier outperforms CNN models, especially on imbalanced classes. Ad-\nditionally, Tarasiou et al. (2023) proposed acquisition-time-specific temporal positional encodings\nto model satellite images over time, while Cong et al. (2022) demonstrated the benefits of using dis-\ntinct spectral positional encodings with ViT. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2023) proposed a modification\nto the ViT architecture, introducing variable tokenization and variable token aggregation methods to\nhandle heterogeneous input data sources in climate and weather modeling. Moreover, Scheibenreif\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\net al. (2022) found that ViT, when combined with self-supervised pre-training, performs on-par with\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks.\nIn the field of cell biology, Sivanandan et al. (2023) utilized ViT with self-supervised pre-training\nto learn representations of cells across multiple fluorescence channels. Furthermore, Hatamizadeh\net al. (2022a;b) leveraged ViT for segmenting 3D MRI images. Hussein et al. (2022) proposed to\ntrain multiple ViTs, one for each input channel, for epileptic seizure predictions.\nIn contrast to previous work, we address a practical challenge in multi-channel imaging, where\ndifferent datasets often have different available channels.* To tackle this challenge, we propose\nChannelViT, which creates image patches from each individual input channel. This simple modifi-\ncation unifies the modeling across data with different input channels and offers robust performance\nat test time, even when only a subset of the channels is available.\nRobustness for Vision Transformer\nRobustness can be defined in different ways. One aspect is\nthe vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Mahmood et al. (2021) found that ViTs are as susceptible\nto white-box adversarial attacks as CNNs. To improve robustness, Robust ViT incorporates more\nrobust components like global pooling (Mao et al., 2022). Additionally, Chefer et al. (2022) propose\nregularization of the relevancy map of ViT to enhance robustness. Zhou et al. (2022); Zhang et al.\n(2021); Song et al. (2022) augments transformers with feature-wise attention to improve robustness\nand performance. Another approach focuses on generalization over distribution shifts Sagawa et al.\n(2019); Liu et al. (2021). Bao & Karaletsos (2023) introduces a context token inferred from ViT’s\nhidden layers to encode group-specific information.\nIn our work, we specifically focus on improving the generalization performance across different\nchannel combinations, which is a common scenario in multi-channel imaging. We argue that the\noriginal ViT is sensitive to changes in input channels, as it computes a single patch token across all\nchannels. In contrast, ChannelViT creates separate patch tokens for each channel, making it inher-\nently more robust to variations in channel availabilities. To further enhance channel robustness, we\nintroduce hierarchical channel sampling (HCS) during training. This methodology draws inspira-\ntion from prior studies on channel dropout Srivastava et al. (2014); Tompson et al. (2015); Hou &\nWang (2019). However, instead of dropping out intermediate channels, our approach introduces a\ntwo-stage sampling algorithm designed to selectively mask out the input channels.\n3\nMETHOD\nChannelViT is a modification of the original Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture proposed by\nDosovitskiy et al.. Unlike the original architecture, which condenses each multi-channel image\npatch into a single ‘word’ token, ChannelViT segregates channel-specific information into multiple\ntokens. This simple yet effective modification yields three key advantages:\n1. ChannelViT facilitates reasoning across both positions and channels with Transformer;\n2. By transforming the channel dimension into the sequence length dimension, ChannelViT\ncan seamlessly manage inputs with varying sets of channels;\n3. ChannelViT can utilize existing efficient implementations of ViT.\nIn the following paragraphs, we explore the architecture and implementation of ChannelViT in de-\ntail. Figure 1 provides a visual overview of the model.\n3.1\nCHANNEL VISION TRANSFORMER (CHANNELVIT)\nPatch embeddings\nConsider an input image x with dimensions H × W × C. Given a patch size\nof P × P, this image can be reshaped into a sequence of non-overlapping patches\n[x[c1, p1], . . . , x[c1, pN], x[c2, p1], . . . , x[c2, pN],\n. . .\n, x[cC, pN], . . . , x[cC, pN]] ,\nwhere x[ci, pn] corresponds to the n-th P × P image patch at channel ci and N = HW/P 2. As the\nTransformer encoder requires a sequence of one-dimensional vectors, each patch is flattened into a\n*For example (https://github.com/chrieke/awesome-satellite-imagery-datasets), satellite imaging often involves multiple signals\nsuch as Sentinel-1 (SAR), Sentinel-2, UAV, etc.\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n1D vector. Unlike ViT, which generates a single token for a multi-channel image patch, ChannelViT\nproduces one token from every single-channel image patch.\nTied image filters\nWe apply a learnable linear projection W ∈RP 2×D to the flattened patches. It\nis important to note that in a regular ViT, each channel has its own weights in the linear projection\nlayer. In ChannelViT, our preliminary experiments suggest that tying the image filters across chan-\nnels offer superior performance compared to untied image filters (Appendix C.3). Therefore, we tie\nthe learnable projection W across channels. The intuition behind this is that the low-level image\nfilters can be shared across channels (Ghiasi et al., 2022), and tying the parameters can improve the\nmodel’s robustness across channels.\nChannel-aware and position-aware patch embeddings\nDespite tying the linear filter across\nchannels, it remains essential to preserve channel-specific information, given the distinct char-\nacteristics of different channels (Appendix C.4).\nWe introduce learnable channel embeddings\n[chn1, . . . , chnC], where chnc ∈RD. In line with the original ViT, we also incorporate learnable\npositional embeddings to maintain positional information of each patch. We denote the positional\nembeddings as [pos1, . . . , posN], where posn ∈RD. It’s worth noting that these position em-\nbeddings are also shared across channels, enabling ChannelViT to recognize the same image patch\nacross different channels. Finally, we prepend a learnable classifier token CLS ∈RD to the sequence\nto encode global image features. The resulting input sequence can be written as\n\u0002\nCLS,\npos1 + chn1 + Wx[c1, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chn1 + Wx[c1, pN],\n. . . ,\npos1 + chnC + Wx[cC, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chnC + Wx[cC, pN]\n\u0003\n.\nTransformer encoder\nFollowing the original VIT, we feed the above input sequence into a Trans-\nformer encoder, which captures dependencies between image patches by embedding each patch\nbased on its similarity to others Vaswani et al. (2017). Specifically, the Transformer encoder com-\nprises alternating layers of multiheaded self-attention blocks and MLP blocks. Layer normalization,\nas proposed by Ba et al. (2016), is performed before each block, and residual connections He et al.\n(2016) are established after each block. We use the final layer representation of the CLS token to\nrepresent the input image. For classification tasks, a linear classifier is employed, followed by a\nSoftmax function, to predict the corresponding label. We utilize the standard cross entropy loss as\nour training objective.\n3.2\nHIERARCHICAL CHANNEL SAMPLING (HCS)\nTraining ChannelViT directly presents two challenges: 1) The sequence length becomes propor-\ntional to the number of channels, leading to a quadratic surge in the number of attentions required\nfor computation; 2) Training exclusively on all channels may result in the model not being pre-\npared for partial channels at test time, thereby affecting its generalization capability. To mitigate\nthese issues, we propose applying hierarchical channel sampling (HCS) during the training process.\nSpecifically, for an image x with C channels, we proceed as follows:\n1. First, we sample a random variable m uniformly from the set {1, 2, . . . , C}. This m repre-\nsents the number of channels that we will utilize during this training step;\n2. Next, we sample a channel combination Cm uniformly from all channel combinations that\nconsist of m channels;\n3. Finally, we return the image with only the sampled channels x[Cm].\nHCS shares similarity to channel dropout Tompson et al. (2015), but it differs in terms of the prior\ndistribution imposed on the sampled channels. In channel dropout, each channel is dropped based\non a given probability independently. The probability of having m channels varies drastically for\ndifferent ms, which can negatively impact the final performance (Figure 3). In contrast, since m\nis sampled uniformly over the total number of channels, HCS ensures that the sampling procedure\nequally covers each m. Finally, we note that HCS is only employed during training. At test time,\nChannelViT has access to all input channels.\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nImageNet\nJUMP-CP\nSo2Sat\nCorrelations across different input channels\nImageNet\nJUMP-CP\nSo2Sat\nCorrelations across ChannelViT’s learned channel embeddings\n1.0\n-1.0\n0.0\nFigure 2: Correlation patterns among image channels (left) and the learned channel embeddings\n(right) for ImageNet, JUMPCP, and So2Sat. ImageNet displays a strong correlation among the three\nRGB input channels while JUMPCP and So2Sat show minimal correlation between different signal\nsources (Fluorescence vs. Brightfield, Sentinel 1 vs Sentinel 2).\nHCS can also be interpreted as simulating test-time distributions during training. Compared to group\ndistributionally robust optimization (Sagawa et al., 2019), HCS minimizes the mean loss rather than\nthe worst-case loss. This approach is logical when considering channel robustness, as having more\nchannels will naturally enhance performance. We don’t want the model to over-focus on the worst-\ncase loss, which typically corresponds to situations when we sample very few channels.\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\nWe evaluate ChannelViT across three image classification benchmarks: ImageNet Deng et al.\n(2009), JUMP-CP Chandrasekaran et al. (2022), and So2Sat Zhu et al. (2019). In Figure 2 (top), we\nillustrate the correlation among different input channels for each dataset. As observed, ImageNet\nexhibits a strong correlation among the three RGB channels. For JUMP-CP, while there is a strong\ncorrelation within the fluorescence channels and within the brightfield channels, there is minimal\nto no correlation between the brightfield and the fluorescence channels. A similar group structure\namong the channels is observed for So2Sat. Due to space constraints, our primary focus in the main\npaper is on the comparison between ViT and ChannelViT. For additional comparisons with Mul-\ntiViT (Hussein et al., 2022), please refer to Appendix B.1. Comparisons with FANs (Zhou et al.,\n2022) can be found in Appendix B.2.\nJUMP-CP\nThe JUMP-CP benchmark, established by the JUMP-Cell Painting Consortium, serves\nas a microscopy imaging standard. In alignment with the work of Chandrasekaran et al. (2022), we\nutilize the task of perturbation detection from cell images as a means to evaluate and compare the\nefficacy of various representation models. It is important to recognize that while perturbation detec-\ntion is a valuable task, it is not the ultimate objective of cell imaging modeling; rather, it provides\nan interpretable metric for model assessment. The dataset includes a total of 160 perturbations. We\nfocused on a compound perturbation plate ‘BR00116991’, which contains 127k training images,\n45k validation images, and 45k testing images. Each cell image contains 8 channels, comprising\nboth fluorescence information (first five channels) and brightfield information (last three channels).\nSo2Sat\nThis satellite imaging benchmark encompasses half a million image patches from\nSentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, distributed across 42 global urban agglomerations. Each im-\nage patch incorporates 18 channels, with 8 originating from Sentinel-1 and the remaining 10 from\nSentinel-2. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the prediction of the climate zone for\neach respective image patch, with a total of 17 distinct climate zones being represented.\nImplementation details\nWe utilize the Vision Transformer (ViT) implementation provided by\nFacebook Research†. During training, we minimize the cross entropy loss. To ensure a fair com-\nparison, both ViT and ChannelViT are subjected to identical optimization settings. These settings\nencompass the use of the Adam optimizer, a learning rate scheduler featuring linear warmup and co-\nsine decay, and a cosine scheduler for the weight decay parameter. For a more detailed description\nof the hyper-parameter settings, we direct readers to the Appendix.\n5\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 1: Validation accuracy on ImageNet under different testing conditions (using all three channels\nor only one channel). We observe that 1) hierarchical channel sampling significantly boosts single-\nchannel performance at test time; 2) ChannelViT consistently outperforms the ViT baseline. The\nexpert models, trained using only one channel, represent the upper bound of potential performance.\nBackbone\nUse hierarchical\nchannel sampling?\nVal Acc.\non RGB\nVal Acc.\non R-only\nVal Acc.\non G-only\nVal Acc.\non B-only\nModels trained on three channels (RGB)\nViT-S/16\n✗\n71.49\n29.39\n33.79\n21.18\nViT-S/16\n✓\n73.01\n68.86\n69.78\n67.59\nChannelViT-S/16\n✓\n74.64\n69.90\n70.30\n68.48\nExpert models trained on only one channel\nViT-S/16 (R-only)\nN/A\n—\n70.04\n—\n—\nViT-S/16 (G-only)\nN/A\n—\n—\n70.61\n—\nViT-S/16 (B-only)\nN/A\n—\n—\n—\n69.47\nNumber of channels sampled for training\nProbability\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nNumber of channels used for evaluation\nPerturbation prediction accuracy\n0.00%\n20.00%\n40.00%\n60.00%\n80.00%\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nNumber of channels used for evaluation\nPerturbation prediction accuracy\n0.00%\n20.00%\n40.00%\n60.00%\n80.00%\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nViT-S/16\nChannelViT-S/16\nDistributions of the input channels\n#channels sampled for training\n#channels sampled for evaluation\n#channels sampled for evaluation\n                                       Accuracy                         \n                                       Accuracy                         \n                                      Probability                        \nHierarchical Channel Sampling\nNo dropout \nInput channel dropout 0.1\nInput channel dropout 0.2\nInput channel dropout 0.3\nFigure 3: HCS vs. input channel dropout on JUMP-CP (trained on all 8 channels).

The accuracy is evaluated across all channel combinations, with the mean accuracy\nreported for combinations with an equal number of channels (represented on the horizontal axis).\nOn the right, we illustrate the probability distribution of the sampled channel combinations during\nthe training process. We observe 1) ViTs trained with input channel dropout tend to favor channel\ncombinations that are sampled the most; 2) ChannelViT with input channel dropout outperforms ViT\nwith input channel dropout; 3) HCS surpasses input channel dropout in terms of channel robustness.\n4.1\nIMAGENET\nTable 1 showcases our results on ImageNet, using ViT small as the representation backbone and\na patch size of 16 by 16. We observe that without applying hierarchical channel sampling, ViT-\nS/16 achieves a validation accuracy of 71.49 using all three channels but fails to generalize when\nonly one channel is provided at test time. Simulating this test-time channel drop during training\nvia hierarchical channel sampling (HCS) significantly improves performance. For instance, the\nvalidation accuracy for using only the red channel improves from 29.39 to 68.86, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of HCS as a regularizer for enforcing channel robustness. Lastly, while there is limited\nroom for improvement due to the strong correlations among the input RGB channels, ChannelViT\nstill consistently outperforms the corresponding ViT baseline (by 1.2 on average), narrowing the gap\n(1.30 →0.48) to the expert models that are trained using only one channel.\n4.2\nJUMP-CP: MICROSCOPY CELL IMAGING\nWe present our results on the microscopy cell imaging benchmark, JUMP-CP, in Table 2. This\nbenchmark involves a 160-way classification task. Due to computational constraints, we utilize ViT-\nS as our representation backbone. We consider both the standard resolution with a patch size of\n16x16 and a high-resolution model with a patch size of 8x8.\n†https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino/blob/main/vision_transformer.py\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 2: Test accuracy of 160-way perturbed gene prediction on JUMP-CP. Two training settings\nare considered: one using only 5 fluorescence channels and the other incorporating all 8 channels,\nwhich includes 3 additional brightfield channels. During testing, all possible channel combinations\nare evaluated and we report the mean accuracies for combinations with the same number of channels\n(See Appendix B for detailed error analyses). We observe that cross channel reasoning is crucial\nwhen the inputs have independent information (fluorescence vs. brightfield).\nViT-S/16 ChannelViT-S/16 ViT-S/16 ChannelViT-S/16 ViT-S/8 ChannelViT-S/8\nUse hierarchical\nchannel sampling?\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nTraining on 5 fluorescence channels\n#channels\nfor testing\n5 channels\n48.41\n53.41\n55.51\n56.78\n60.29\n60.03\n4 channels\n0.85\n15.13\n43.59\n45.94\n48.80\n49.34\n3 channels\n1.89\n5.12\n33.14\n35.45\n37.13\n38.15\n2 channels\n1.46\n1.22\n25.24\n26.57\n27.40\n27.99\n1 channel\n0.54\n1.25\n20.49\n21.43\n21.30\n21.58\nTraining on all 8 channels (5 fluorescence channels & 3 brightfield channels)\n#channels\nfor testing\n8 channels\n52.06\n66.22\n56.87\n68.09\n66.44\n74.77\n7 channels\n5.91\n41.03\n49.35\n61.02\n59.01\n68.42\n6 channels\n1.81\n24.57\n42.38\n53.45\n51.29\n61.26\n5 channels\n2.46\n14.20\n35.78\n45.50\n43.39\n53.05\n4 channels\n2.38\n8.56\n29.84\n37.37\n35.60\n43.87\n3 channels\n2.70\n5.65\n24.94\n29.68\n28.59\n34.19\n2 channels\n2.63\n3.24\n21.54\n23.77\n23.32\n25.73\n1 channel\n3.00\n2.08\n19.92\n20.84\n20.41\n21.20\nIn the first part of our analysis, we train all models using only the five fluorescence channels and\nevaluate their performance on the test set under various input channel combinations. Our obser-\nvations are as follows: 1) HCS significantly enhances the channel robustness for both ViT and\nChannelViT; 2) High-resolution models consistently outperform their low-resolution counterparts;\n3) With the exception of the 5-channel evaluation with a patch size of 8x8, ChannelViT consistently\noutperforms ViT.\nIn the latter part of our analysis, we utilize all available channels for training, which includes three\nadditional brightfield channels for each image. For ViT, the high-resolution ViT-S/8 model improves\nfrom 60.29 to 66.44, demonstrating the importance of the additional brightfield information, while\nthe improvement for ViT-S/16 is marginal (from 55.51 to 56.87). When focusing on ChannelViT,\nwe observe a significant performance boost over its ViT counterpart. ChannelViT-S/16 outperforms\nViT-S/16 by 11.22 (68.09 vs 56.87) and ChannelViT-S/8 outperforms ViT-S/8 by 8.33 (74.77 vs.\n66.44). These improvements are consistent across different channel combinations. As we have\nseen in Figure 2, fluorescence and brightfield channels provide distinct information. ChannelViT\neffectively reasons across channels, avoiding the need to collapse all information into a single token\nat the first layer, thereby enhancing performance.\nLastly, we delve into a comparative analysis between input channel dropout and hierarchical chan-\nnel sampling, as depicted in Figure 3. It is evident from our observations that the ViT model,\nwhen trained with HCS, consistently surpasses the performance of those trained with input channel\ndropout across all channel combinations. Furthermore, we discern a pronounced correlation be-\ntween the performance of models trained with input channel dropout and the probability distribution\nof the number of channels sampled during training.\nData Efficiency\nIn the realm of microscopy imaging, we often encounter situations where not all\nchannels are available for every cell due to varying experiment guidelines and procedures. Despite\nthis, the goal remains to develop a universal model capable of operating on inputs with differing\nchannels. ChannelViT addresses this issue by treating different channels as distinct input tokens,\nmaking it particularly useful in scenarios where not all channels are available for all data. Table 3\npresents a scenario where varying proportions (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) of the training data\nhave access to all eight channels, with the remaining data only having access to the five fluorescence\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 3: ViT vs. ChannelViT when we have varying channel availability during training. Both mod-\nels are trained using HCS. The accuracy is evaluated using five fluorescence channels (top) and all\neight channels (bottom). For the middle three columns where we have mixed training data, we re-\nport the mean (and std) accuracy over three randomly generated partitions. ChannelViT consistently\noutperforms ViT across all settings, and the performance gap notably widens as access to more 8-\nchannel data is provided.\nCombine fluorescence-only data and 8-channel data for training\n% fluorescence-only data\n100%\n75%\n50%\n25%\n0%\n% 8-channel data\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nEvaluating on 5 fluorescence channels\nViT-S/16\n55.51\n52.55±2.68\n51.65±2.14\n49.53±1.39\n45.75\nChannelViT-S/16\n56.78\n58.01±1.77\n58.19±1.49\n58.42±1.37\n57.60\nEvaluating on all 8 channels\nViT-S/16\n—\n50.29±1.93\n52.47±1.82\n54.64±1.01\n56.87\nChannelViT-S/16\n—\n57.97±1.36\n61.88±0.91\n64.80±0.89\n68.09\nchannels. The performance of ViT and ChannelViT is evaluated at test time using both the five\nfluorescence channels (top section) and all eight channels (bottom section).\nOur observations are as follows: 1) When only a limited amount of 8-channel data (25%) is available,\nboth ChannelViT and ViT show a decrease in performance when utilizing eight channels at test time\ncompared to five channels; 2) As the availability of 8-channel data increases, the performance of\nthe ViT baseline on the fluorescence evaluation steadily declines (from 55.51 to 45.75), while the\nperformance of ChannelViT sees a slight improvement (from 56.78 to 57.60); 3) When evaluated on\nall eight channels, ChannelViT significantly outperforms ViT, with an average gap of 9.62.\nChannel-specific attention visualization\nAttention heatmaps, generated by Vision Transformers\n(ViTs), have emerged as a valuable tool for interpreting model decisions. For instance, Chefer et al.\n(2021) introduced a relevance computation method, which assigns local relevance based on the Deep\nTaylor Decomposition principle and subsequently propagates these relevance scores through the\nlayers. However, a limitation of ViTs is their tendency to amalgamate information across different\nchannels. In the realm of microscopy imaging, discerning the contribution of each fluorescence\nchannel to the predictions is vital due to their distinct biological implications.\nFigure 4 (right) presents the class-specific relevance visualizations for ViT-S/8 and ChannelViT-S/8.\nFor the top cell labeled KRAS, ChannelViT appears to utilize information from the Mito channel.\nFor the bottom cell labeled KCNH76, ChannelViT seems to utilize information from the ER and\nRNA channels for its prediction. Compared to ViT, ChannelViT facilitates the examination of con-\ntributions made by individual channels.\nIn Figure 4 (left), we further compute the maximum attention score (averaged over 100 cells) for\neach cell label (perturbed gene) and each input channel. Our observations indicate that ChannelViT\nfocuses on different channels for different labels (corresponding to perturbed genes), with the Mito\nchannel emerging as the most significant information source. This heatmap, which describes the\ndiscriminability of different labels over different channels, can also aid in better understanding the\nrelationships between different gene perturbations.\nTime efficiency\nOne limitation of ChannelViT is the additional computational cost incurred when\nexpanding the channel dimension into the sequence length dimension. Implementing ChannelViT\nwithout HCS increases the training time from approximately 3 hours to 12 hours. With HCS, the\ntraining duration for ChannelViT is reduced to about 10 hours. During inference, ChannelViT\nrequires approximately 1.6 times more time than its ViT counterpart. An interesting future di-\nrection would be to combine ChannelViT with more efficient attention mechanisms, such as Lin-\nformer Wang et al. (2020) and LongNet Ding et al. (2023), which scale linearly with sequence\nlength. We direct the reader to Appendix C.1 for a comprehensive analysis of the running times.\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nCell label: KRAS\nAGP\nDNA\nER\nMito\nRNA\nBF-1\nBF-2\nBF-3\n8-channel view\nSingle-channel view\nInput\nAttention\nInput\nAttention\nViT\nChannelViT\nCell label: KCNH76\nAGP\nDNA\nER\nMito\nRNA\nBF-1\nBF-2\nBF-3\nFluorescence channels\nBrightfield channels\nCell label\n0.0\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n1.0\n0.5\nFigure 4: Left: Class-specific relevance attribution of ChannelViT-S/8 for each cell label (perturbed\ngene) on JUMP-CP.

Performances are\nevaluated using all channels (Sentinel 1 & 2).\n4.3\nSO2SAT: SATELLITE IMAGING\nOur results on the So2Sat satellite imaging benchmark are presented in Table 4. We evaluate two\nofficial splits: random split and city split, training both ViT-S/8 and ChannelViT-S/8 models using\nhierarchical channel sampling across all channels (Sentinel 1 & 2).\nUpon evaluation, ChannelViT demonstrates superior performance over its ViT counterpart, with an\nimprovement of 1.28 for the random split and 0.53 for the more challenging city split. In the realm\nof satellite imaging, Sentinel 1 channels are derived from a Synthetic Aperture Radar operating on\nthe C-band, while Sentinel-2 is a multispectral high-resolution imaging mission. It’s worth noting\nthat Sentinel-2 data can be cloud-affected, underscoring the importance of models that can robustly\noperate under partial signals using only Sentinel 1. In both random and city splits, ChannelViT\nsignificantly outperforms ViT (59.75 vs. 50.62 in random split and 47.39 vs. 41.07 in city split).\nLastly, we explore the efficiency of ChannelViT in combining satellite training data with different\nsignals. As depicted in Figure 5, we consider varying proportions (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) of\nthe training data with access to both Sentinel 1 & 2 signals, while the remaining data only has access\nto Sentinel 1 signals. The models are evaluated using all Sentinel 1 & 2 signals. Our observations\nconsistently show ChannelViT outperforming ViT.\nInterpreting the channel embeddings learned by ChannelViT\nFigure 2 presents the correla-\ntions between the input channels. It’s noteworthy that the first four channels of Sentinel-1 corre-\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nspond to: 1) the real part of the VH channel; 2) the imaginary part of the VH channel; 3) the real\npart of the VV channel; and 4) the imaginary part of the VV channel. These four input channels are\nuncorrelated, as evidenced by the bottom left corner of the So2Sat visualization heatmap. However,\nupon examining the correlations between the learned channel embeddings, we observe a high cor-\nrelation between the real and imaginary parts of both VV and VH channels. This intuitively aligns\nwith the fact that the real and imaginary parts are equivalent in terms of the information they pro-\nvide. This demonstrates that ChannelViT learns meaningful channel embeddings, which can provide\nadditional insights into the relationships between different input signals.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, our proposed model, ChannelViT, effectively addresses the unique challenges of\nmulti-channel imaging domains. By enhancing reasoning across input channels and seamlessly\nhandling inputs with varying sets of channels, ChannelViT has consistently outperformed its ViT\ncounterpart in our evaluations on ImageNet and diverse applications such as medical, microscopy\ncell, and satellite imaging. The introduction of Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) further bol-\nsters the model’s robustness when testing with different channel combinations. Moreover, Chan-\nnelViT not only improves data efficiency but also provides additional interpretability, underscoring\nits potential for broad applications in the field of multi-channel imaging.\nREFERENCES\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

In this subsection, we offer a\ncomprehensive example of HCS in conjunction with ChannelViT and ViT.\nHierarchical Channel Sampling for ChannelViT\nGiven a three-channel input x, as per Sec-\ntion 3.1, the input sequence for the Transformer encoder can be expressed as\n\u0002\nCLS,\npos1 + chn1 + Wx[c1, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chn1 + Wx[c1, pN],\npos1 + chn2 + Wx[c2, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chn2 + Wx[c2, pN],\npos1 + chn3 + Wx[c3, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chn3 + Wx[c3, pN]\n\u0003\n.\nLet’s assume that our sampled channel combination from the HCS algorithm is {1, 3}. The corre-\nsponding input sequence for the Transformer encoder would then be modified accordingly.\n\u0002\nCLS,\npos1 + chn1 + Wx[c1, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chn1 + Wx[c1, pN],\npos1 + chn3 + Wx[c3, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chn3 + Wx[c3, pN]\n\u0003\n.\nIt’s important to note that reducing the number of channels only modifies the sequence length. Fur-\nthermore, since we sample the channel combinations for each training step, the channels utilized for\neach image can vary across different epochs.\nHierarchical Channel Sampling for ViT\nGiven the identical three-channel input x, the input\nsequence for the Transformer encoder can be articulated as\n\u0002\nCLS,\npos1 + W1x[c1, p1] + W2x[c2, p1] + W3x[c3, p1] + b,\n. . . ,\nposn + W1x[c1, pn] + W2x[c2, pn] + W3x[c3, pn] + b\n\u0003\n.\nHere W1, W2, W3 represent the weights associated with each input channel, and b is the bias term.\nLet’s continue with the assumption that our sampled channel combination from the HCS algorithm\nremains {1, 3}. We then adjust the above input sequence as follows:\n\u0002\nCLS,\npos1 + W1x[c1, p1]3/2 + W3x[c3, p1]3/2 + b,\n. . . ,\nposn + W1x[c1, pn]3/2 + W3x[c3, pn]3/2 + b\n\u0003\n.\nIt’s noteworthy that, in addition to masking the input from the second channel, we also rescale the\nremaining channels by a factor of 3/2. This is akin to the approach of Srivastava et al. (2014),\nand is done to ensure that the output of the linear patch layer maintains the same scale, despite the\nreduction in input channels.\nA.2\nTRAINING WITH VIT AND CHANNELVIT\nBackbone\nFor the vision transformer backbone, we employ the PyTorch implementation provided\nby Facebook Research‡. Due to computational constraints, we primarily utilize the ‘vit-small‘ ar-\nchitecture, which has an embedding dimension of 386, a depth of 12, 6 heads, an MLP hidden\ndimension of 4 × 386 = 1544 and pre layer normalization. We also briefly experiment ‘vit-base‘\nwhich increases the embedding dimension to 768, the number of heads to 12, and the MLP hidden\ndimension to 4 × 768 = 3072. For ChannelViT, we retain the same parameter settings as its ViT\ncounterparts for the Transformer encoder. Note that ChannelViT has a marginally smaller number\nof parameters, as the first linear projection layer is now shared across channels.\nObjective\nWe employ the standard cross-entropy loss for both ViT and ChannelViT across the four\nimage classification benchmarks. Specifically, we utilize the Transformer encoder’s representation\nfor the CLS token at the final layer, and append a linear layer, followed by a Softmax function, to\npredict the probability of each class.\n‡https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino/blob/main/vision_transformer.py\n14\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nOptimization\nFor optimization, we employ the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019).\nThe learning rate is warmed up for the initial 10 epochs, peaking at 0.0005 (Goyal et al., 2017), after\nwhich it gradually decays to 10−6 following a cosine scheduler. To mitigate overfitting, we apply\nweight decay to the weight parameters, excluding the bias and normalization terms. The weight\ndecay starts at 0.04 and incrementally increases during training, following a cosine scheduler, up to\na maximum of 0.4. Each model is trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 256. The training is\nconducted on an AWS p4d.24xlarge instance equipped with 8 A100 GPUs.\nA.3\nTRAINING ON DATASETS WITH VARYING CHANNEL AVAILABILITY\nIn Table 3 and Figure 5, we investigated scenarios where our training datasets exhibited varying\nchannel availability. This section provides a detailed description of the training settings we employed\nand presents additional results for an alternative setting.\nChannelViT and ViT\nDespite the different channel combinations in the training datasets, we\nutilize a consistent approach (as detailed in Appendix ) to encode the images for both ChannelViT\nand ViT. For ChannelViT, this entails having varying sequence lengths for images with different\nnumbers of channels. For ViT, this involves masking out the unavailable channels and rescaling the\nremaining ones.\nObjective\nWe continue to use the cross-entropy loss. However, in this instance, there are two\npotential methods for data sampling.\n1. Sampling a random batch from each dataset and minimizing their average loss. This ap-\nproach will assign more weight to datasets with fewer examples. Mathematically, it opti-\nmizes\nLupsample = |D1| + |D2|\n2|D1|\nLD1 + |D1| + |D2|\n2|D2|\nLD2,\nwhere we assume D1 and D2 are the two training datasets with different channels.\n2. Concatenate the two datasets and draw a batch from the combined datasets. This approach\nsimply minimizes the average loss\nLaverage = LD1 + LD2.\nOur preliminary experiments indicate that the second method consistently outperformed the first.\nFor instance, in JUMP-CP when training with 25% 8-channel data, ChannelViT-S/16 achieves\n57.97% when training with Laverage but only reachs 45.52% when training with Lupsample. Simi-\nlarly, ViT-S/16 achieves 50.29% when training with Laverage but only scores 42.58% when training\nwith Lupsample. We hypothesize that models exhibit overfitting when trained using the upsampling\nloss. Therefore, we report the numbers for the normal average loss Laverage in Table 3 and Figure 5.\nA.4\nEVALUATION ACROSS ALL CHANNEL COMBINATIONS\nTo assess the channel robustness of the trained models, we enumerate all possible channel combina-\ntions and report the corresponding accuracy for each.\nFor instance, in Table 2, we have considered two training scenarios: the top section pertains to\ntraining on 5 fluorescence channels, while the bottom section pertains to training on all 8 channels.\nFor the top section, we can evaluate the models for all subsets of the 5 fluorescence channels. This\nincludes\n• Combinations with 5 channels: there is only one C5\n5 = 1 combination;\n• Combinations with 4 channels: there are C4\n5 = 5 combinations;\n• Combinations with 3 channels: there are C3\n5 = 10 combinations;\n• Combinations with 2 channels: there are C2\n5 = 10 combinations;\n• Combinations with 1 channels: there are C1\n5 = 5 combinations.\n15\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nConsequently, we evaluate a total of 1+5+10+10+5 = 31 channel combinations. Given a specific\nchannel combination, we mask out the testing images accordingly (as described in Appendix A.1)\nand compute the corresponding testing accuracy. We then report the average accuracy over com-\nbinations that have the same number of channels. As one might intuitively expect, models tend to\nperform better when provided with more channels.\nA.5\nDATASET DETAILS\nIn this section, we provide a detailed description of our datasets and their corresponding input chan-\nnels.\nJUMP-CP, 160-way classification\nWe use the processed version of JUMP-CP released by Bao\n& Karaletsos (2023)§. Each image consists of a single masked cell and includes five fluorescence\nchannels: AGP, DNA, ER, Mito, RNA, as well as three brightfield channels: HighZBF (Brightfield-\n1), LowZBF (Brightfield-2), and Brightfield (Brightfield-3). Each cell has been perturbed by a\nchemical compound, and the goal is to identify the gene target of the chemical perturbation.\nSo2Sat, 17-way classification\nWe use the processed version So2Sat released by the original au-\nthors Zhu et al. (2020a)¶. Each image patch consists of 8 channels from Sentinel-1:\n1. the real part of the unfiltered VH channel;\n2. the imaginary part of the unfiltered VH channel;\n3. the real part of the unfiltered VV channel;\n4. the imaginary part of the unfiltered VV channel;\n5. the intensity of the refined LEE filtered VH channel;\n6. the intensity of the refined LEE filtered VV channel;\n7. the real part of the refined LEE filtered covariance matrix off-diagonal element;\n8. the imaginary part of the refined LEE filtered covariance matrix off-diagonal element.\nand 10 channels from Sentinel-2: Band B2, Band B3, Band B4, Band B5, Band B6, Band B7, Band\nB8, Band B8a, Band B11 and Band B12. The task is to predict the climate zone for each respective\nimage patch, with a total of 17 distinct climate zones being represented.\nB\nADDITIONAL BASELINES\nB.1\nBASELINE: CONCATENATING FEATURES FROM MULTIPLE SINGLE-CHANNEL VITS\nHussein et al. (2022) utilized ViTs for epileptic seizure predictions, proposing a method to train\nmultiple ViTs, one for each input channel. The final image representation is derived by aggregating\nthe output CLS tokens across all single-channel ViTs. An MLP is then attached to these aggregated\nfeatures to predict the image label. In this section, we implement this baseline based on the paper,\ntermed MultiViT, and evaluate its performance both with and without HCS.\nTable 5 presents our results on JUMP-CP when training using all eight channels. Without HCS, Mul-\ntiViT underperforms compared to ViT when evaluated on all channels, despite having eight times\nmore parameters. This underscores the importance of parameter sharing across different channels to\ncombat overfitting. However, when testing on a subset of channels, MultiViT outperforms ViT, as\neach ViT operates on a single channel, thereby improving robustness to changes in the input chan-\nnels. Interestingly, MultiViT does not perform well with HCS. While the accuracy improves when\ntesting on a subset of channels, the accuracy significantly decreases (from 49.06 to 30.25) when us-\ning all eight channels. We hypothesize that this is due to the channel-wise feature aggregation being\nperformed after the single-channel ViTs, preventing the model from conditioning the representation\nbased on the input channel availability.\n§https://github.com/insitro/ContextViT\n¶https://github.com/zhu-xlab/So2Sat-LCZ42\n16\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 5: 160-way test accuracy of MultiViT (Hussein et al., 2022) on JUMP-CP. All models are\nbased on the ViT-S/16 backbone and are trained on all 8 channels. During testing, all possible\nchannel combinations are evaluated and we report the mean accuracies for combinations with the\nsame number of channels. MultiViT learns a separate ViT per channel and aggregates their output\nCLS tokens together to form the overall image representation. Since the ViT encoder is separate for\neach channel, it offers better channel robustness than the vanilla ViT. However, if we focus on the\nperformance using all channels, it actually leads to worse performance than the vanilla ViT-S/16,\nhighlighting the importance of parameter tying on the application of cell imaging.\nViT\nS/16\nMultiViT\nS/16\nChannelViT\nS/16\nViT\nS/16\nMultiViT\nS/16\nChannelViT\nS/16\nUse hierarchical\nchannel sampling?\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✓\n#channels\nfor testing\n8 channels\n52.06\n49.06\n66.22\n56.87\n30.25\n68.09\n7 channels\n5.91\n34.10\n41.03\n49.35\n29.04\n61.02\n6 channels\n1.81\n23.77\n24.57\n42.38\n27.44\n53.45\n5 channels\n2.46\n17.09\n14.20\n35.78\n25.69\n45.50\n4 channels\n2.38\n12.98\n8.56\n29.84\n23.96\n37.37\n3 channels\n2.70\n10.58\n5.65\n24.94\n22.34\n29.68\n2 channels\n2.63\n9.61\n3.24\n21.54\n20.89\n23.77\n1 channel\n3.00\n7.97\n2.08\n19.92\n19.85\n20.84\nTable 6: 160-way test accuracy of FAN (Zhou et al., 2022) on JUMP-CP.

FAN incorporates a channel-\nwise self-attention mechanism following the standard location-wise self-attention in the transformer\nencoder. This enhances the model’s ability to reason across both input and hidden channels, outper-\nforming the ViT baseline.

There are three key differences be-\ntween the two models:\n1. ChannelViT learns a single ViT across all channels, rather than one ViT for each channel;\n2. ChannelViT is aware of the input channel availability at the input patch sequence, while\nthe single-channel ViTs in MultiViT operate independently;\n3. ChannelViT allows cross-channel cross-location attention, while MultiViT only permits\ncross-location attention.\nB.2\nBASELINE: FULLY ATTENTIONAL NETWORKS (FANS)\nZhou et al. (2022) introduced a family of Fully Attentional Networks (FANs) that combine channel-\nwise attention with the MLP in a transformer encoder layer. Notably, the channels in this context\n17\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 7: 160-way test accuracy of ResNet50 and ResNet152 (Zhou et al., 2022) on JUMP-CP.

FANs aggregate feature channels with high correlation values\nacross the transformer encoder layers and isolate outlier features with low correlation values.\nWe adopted the implementation provided at https://github.com/NVlabs/FAN/blob/\nmaster/models/fan.py and evaluated the FAN small with a patch size of 16 by 16. It’s\nworth noting that FAN, by default, employs four stacks of 3 by 3 convolution layers (each followed\nby GELU activations) to construct the input patch tokens, whereas ViT and ChannelViT use a single\nlinear layer over the 16 by 16 input patches. We refer to this FAN baseline as FAN S/16 (conv patch).\nWe also experimented with replacing these convolution layers with the same linear projection used\nin the regular ViT, terming this modified version of FAN as FAN S/16 (linear patch).\nTable 6 presents our results on FANs. Without HCS, the default FAN-S/16 (conv patch) significantly\noutperforms ViT (65.13 vs 52.06), demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-channel attention. How-\never, it still falls short of ChannelViT (65.13 vs. 66.22). Furthermore, when evaluated using a subset\nof channels at test time, its performance significantly declines (1.24 vs. 41.03 on 7 channels). In-\nterestingly, we observed that the FAN with a linear patch embedding layer performs slightly better\nthan the default FAN with convolution patch embeddings.\nWe also investigated training FANs with HCS. We discovered that FAN with convolution patch\nembeddings struggled to learn a meaningful classifier. Replacing the convolution layers with a\nsimple linear transformation improved the performance, and we observed that when trained with\nHCS, FAN-S/16 (linear patch) outperforms its counterpart without HCS when evaluated on a subset\nof channels. However, the performance is still significantly lower than the regular ViT-S/16. We\nhypothesize that since FANs explicitly leverage the correlation between different hidden channels to\nbuild its representations, it becomes more sensitive to channel perturbations at test time.\nIn conclusion, we highlight the key differences between ChannelViT and FANs:\n1. ChannelViT performs cross-channel and cross-location attention jointly, meaning that each\npatch token can attend to a different channel at a different location.\n2. ChannelViT maintains the distinction of different input channels throughout the trans-\nformer encoder and tie the transformer encoder across channels, which we argue enhances\nrobustness to channel changes.\nB.3\nBASELINE: CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS)\nIn this section, we further compare the Vision Transformer (ViT) and ChannelViT with conventional\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We use the widely-adopted ResNet-50 and ResNet-152 as\nour baseline models, as described by He et al. (2016). We present the number of parameters for each\nmodel and their corresponding performance on the JUMPCP dataset in Table7.\n18\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nInitially, we trained the ResNet baselines using Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS), but this\napproach led to training instability, with the top-1 accuracies of both models converging to ap-\nproximately 5% by the end of training. Without HCS, ResNet-50 and ResNet-152 exhibit perfor-\nmance comparable to the ViT-S/8 baseline. Despite having three times more parameters, ResNet-152\nachieves only a slight improvement over ResNet-50. When compared with ChannelViT-S/8, there\nstill remains a significant performance gap.\nWe hypothesize that the parameter sharing within ChannelViT enables the efficient and robust con-\nstruction of channel-invariant filters. Conversely, the explicit cross-channel attention in ChannelViT\neffectively facilitates the model’s ability to infer relationships across related channels.\nAGP\nDNA\nER\nMito\nRNA\nBF-1\nBF-2\nBF-3\n8-channel view\nSingle-channel view\nViT\nChannelViT\nUGT1A9\nInput\nAttention\nInput\nAttention\nGJB4\nTUBB\nInput\nAttention\nInput\nAttention\nHSP90AA1\nFigure 6: Extra visualizations of the relevance heatmaps for both ViT-S/8 (8-channel view) and\nChannelViT-S/8 (single-channel view).

As shown in Table 8, the training\nduration for the ChannelViT-S/16 model on the JUMP-CP dataset, utilizing all eight channels, is\nsignificantly longer without the application of Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS). However, the\nintegration of HCS results in a 15% reduction in training time, decreasing from 12 hours and 6\nminutes to 10 hours and 17 minutes. This demonstrates that HCS not only bolsters the model’s\nrobustness but also markedly enhances training efficiency.\nIn terms of inference cost, ChannelViT exhibits a 1.6 times increase in processing time compared\nto its ViT counterpart, yet it achieves an 11.22% higher accuracy (on an absolute scale). When\nmeasured against the better performing ResNet-152 baseline, Channel ViT’s inference time is only\n1.1 times longer.\nIn this paper, we have explored the ChannelViT utilizing the standard quadratic attention mecha-\nnism. Looking ahead, it would be intriguing to investigate the integration of ChannelViT with more\nefficient algorithms, such as Linformer Wang et al. (2020) and LongNet Ding et al. (2023), which\nscale linearly with sequence length. Such combinations could potentially yield further improve-\nments in both performance and computational efficiency.\nC.2\nATTENTION VISUALIZATION FOR IMAGENET\nFigure 7 illustrates the attention heatmaps for ViT and ChannelViT models trained on the Im-\nageNet dataset.\nFor each image, we generate the rolled out attention scores for two dis-\ntinct classes—espresso and wine for the top image, and elephant and zebra for the bottom im-\nage—following Chefer et al. (2021). We observe that ChannelViT precisely focuses its attention\non the relevant channels, such as the red channel when predicting red wine. In scenarios where the\ncontrast pattern, such as black and white for a zebra, is distributed across all channels, ChannelViT\neffectively utilizes all channels to inform its prediction.\n20\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 7: Relevance visualizations for ViT-S/16 and ChannelViT-S/16 trained on ImageNet.

UNTIED IMAGE FILTERS FOR CHANNELVIT\nIn the main paper, we introduced ChannelViT with a linear projection layer tied across various\nchannels. This section delves into the exploration of flexible weights for each channel (Figure 8).\nThe input sequence to the Transformer encoder can be represented as follows:\n\u0002\nCLS,\npos1 + chn1 + W1x[c1, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chn1 + W1x[c1, pN],\n. . . ,\npos1 + chnC + WCx[cC, p1],\n. . . ,\nposN + chnC + WCx[cC, pN]\n\u0003\n,\nwhere W1, . . . , WC denote the linear transformations associated with the input channels. Table 9\nshowcases our findings on JUMP-CP. It is observed that ChannelViT, when trained with tied image\nfilter weights, consistently outperforms its untied counterpart. We hypothesize that the first layer\nfilters are generally shareable across channels, and tying the parameters can prevent overfitting,\nthereby enhancing the model’s robustness.\nC.4\nABLATION: SHARED VS.

This prompts an\ninvestigation into whether it’s necessary to further condition the final classifier based on the sampled\nchannel combinations. Table 11 presents our ablation analysis, where we consider three methods for\nincorporating the information of the input channels into the final classifier:\n1. The first baseline involves learning a separate linear classifier on top of the ViT embeddings\nfor each channel combination.\n22\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 11: Assessing the necessity of conditioning the classifier on input channel combinations dur-\ning hierarchical channel sampling.

Both models are trained using HCS over all 8 channels.\n2. The second baseline learns an embedding vector for each channel and constructs the repre-\nsentation for the sampled channel combination by summing up all the embeddings for the\nselected channels. This representation is then concatenated with the ViT representation and\nfed to a shared MLP with one hidden layer.\n3. The third method is similar to the second baseline, but uses one-hot encoding as the repre-\nsentation for the sampled channel combination.\nOur observations indicate that all three methods underperform when compared to the basic Chan-\nnelViT, which uses a shared linear classifier across all channel combinations. We hypothesize that\nthe shared linear classifier regularizes the ViT to embed inputs with different channel combinations\ninto the same space. This bias appears to enhance robustness and performance.\nC.6\nBREAKING DOWN THE PERFORMANCE GAIN ON JUMP-CP FOR EACH GENE TARGET\nIn Figure 10, we delve into a comparative analysis of the performance between ChannelViT-S/8 and\nViT-S/8 across each cell label (gene target). Our figure reveals that ChannelViT surpasses ViT in\n90% of the gene targets, while underperforming in the remaining targets. It’s important to note that\nthe gain is computed from a 160-way classification task, where the models are trained to optimize\nthe average loss across all gene targets. If we reframe the problem using a multi-task learning\nobjective, the distribution of gains per gene could potentially differ, and we expect the improvements\nof ChannelViT to be more consistent.\nC.7\nBACKBONE: SMALL VS.

Adhering to the conventions established by Dosovitskiy et al., we evaluated\nthe performance of the ViT and ChannelViT models with small, base, and large backbones. The\nspecific configurations of these models are detailed in Table 12.\nPerformance metrics for the different model sizes are presented in Table 13. We note a trend of\nincremental performance improvements in both ViT and ChannelViT as the number of parameters\nincreases. Concurrently, the performance disparity between ViT and ChannelViT remains consistent\nand significant.\nC.8\nPERFORMANCE VARIATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT CHANNEL COMBINATIONS\nTable 14 presents an analysis of the standard deviation for both ViT and ChannelViT on the JUMP-\nCP dataset, considering all channel combinations. We report the mean accuracies for groups cat-\negorized by the same amount of channels. It is important to note that, despite maintaining a con-\nstant number of channels, the informational content of different channel combinations can differ\nmarkedly, which is reflected in the substantial standard deviations observed in the table.\nTo further dissect and comprehend this variance, we examined the performance gains of Chan-\nnelViT over ViT for each individual channel combination. The mean improvements, along with\ntheir standard deviations, are presented in Table 15. Our analysis substantiates that the performance\nenhancements attributed to ChannelViT are not only consistent across various combinations but also\nnotably significant.\nD\nCAMELYON17-WILDS: MEDICAL IMAGING FOR HISTOPATHOLOGY\nIn this section, we introduce another dataset, Camelyon17-WILDS, which was not included in the\nmain paper due to space limitations.\nD.1\nDATASET\nThe Camelyon17-WILDS dataset encompasses 455k labeled images from five hospitals. The task\ninvolves predicting the presence of tumor tissue in the central region of an image. Although the\ndataset employs standard RGB channels, these are derived from the hematoxylin and eosin stain-\n24\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nTable 14: Analyzing the standard deviation of 160-way perturbed gene prediction on JUMP-CP.\nWe evaluated all possible channel combinations during testing. We report the mean accuracies for\ngroups of combinations that include the same number of channels. However, even when the number\nof channels is held constant, the amount of information conveyed by different channel combinations\ncan vary significantly, leading to a large standard deviation in our results. To isolate and understand\nthis variance, we present the mean and standard deviation of the performance differences between\nChannelViT and ViT for each channel combination in Table 15.\nViT-S/16\nChannelViT-S/16\nViT-S/8\nChannelViT-S/8\nUse hierarchical\nchannel sampling?\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nTraining on all 8 channels (5 fluorescence channels & 3 brightfield channels)\n#channels\nfor testing\n8 channels (C8\n8 = 1)\n56.87\n68.09\n66.44\n74.77\n7 channels (C8\n7 = 8)\n49.35±9.38\n61.02±9.78\n59.01±10.07\n68.42±9.11\n6 channels (C8\n6 = 28)\n42.38±10.64\n53.45±12.40\n51.29±12.47\n61.26±11.91\n5 channels (C8\n5 = 56)\n35.78±10.18\n45.50±13.23\n43.39±12.89\n53.05±13.41\n4 channels (C8\n4 = 70)\n29.84±8.32\n37.37±12.25\n35.60±11.55\n43.87±13.36\n3 channels (C8\n3 = 56)\n24.94±5.43\n29.68±9.22\n28.59±8.38\n34.19±11.10\n2 channels (C8\n2 = 28)\n21.54±2.37\n23.77±4.89\n23.32±4.27\n25.73±6.57\n1 channel (C8\n1 = 8)\n19.92±0.51\n20.84±1.64\n20.41±1.26\n21.20±2.17\nTable 15: Improvements of ChannelViT over its ViT counterpart for the JUMP-CP microscopy\ncell imaging benchmark.

With HCS, it also attains an accuracy of over 97 when using only\ntwo or one channels for predictions.

We\napply DINO pre-training with both ViT and ChannelViT on the ImageNet training data. Upon\ncompletion of the pre-training phase, we conduct the standard linear probing evaluation , and the\nresultant validation accuracy is reported. Hierarchical channel sampling is not used as we found\nthat it introduces extra instability during the DINO pre-training phase. The findings indicate that 1)\nIn comparison to supervised training, DINO inherently enhances the channel robustness for ViT; 2)\nChannelViT consistently outperforms ViT in a significant manner across all evaluations.\nBackbone\nVal Acc.\non RGB\nVal Acc.\non R-only\nVal Acc.\non G-only\nVal Acc.\non B-only\nModels trained on three channels (RGB)\nSupervised ViT-S/16\n71.49\n29.39\n33.79\n21.18\nDINO + ViT-S/16 + LinearProb\n72.62\n64.34\n65.46\n61.12\nDINO + ChannelViT-S/16 + LinearProb\n74.38\n67.44\n67.85\n65.97\nExpert DINO models pre-trained on only one channel\nDINO + ViT-S/16 (R-only) + LinearProb\n—\n67.76\n—\n—\nDINO + ViT-S/16 (G-only) + LinearProb\n—\n—\n68.09\n—\nDINO + ViT-S/16 (B-only) + LinearProb\n—\n—\n—\n66.65\nbut also lower than the accuracy achieved when using only one channel for evaluation in the out-\nof-distribution hospitals (87.97). We hypothesize that this discrepancy is due to the staining shift\nacross hospitals Gao et al. (2022). The mismatch in color distributions results in out-of-distribution\ninputs for the first linear patch embedding layer. To test this hypothesis, we experiment with tying\nthe parameters across different channels for the first linear patch embedding layer. As seen in the\nsecond column, ViT-S/8 with tied weights, while performing slightly worse in the in-distribution\nhospitals, performs significantly better in the out-of-distribution setting. We also explore ViT-B/8\nbut found it exhibited overfitting.\nBy default, we share the first linear patch embedding layer across different channels for ChannelViT.\nOn the out-of-distribution hospital, ChannelViT-S/8 significantly outperforms ViT-S/8 (92.67 vs.\n89.14). We also observe that if we untie the weights for different channels in ChannelViT, the\ngeneralization performance degrades.\nE\nSELF-SUPERVISED PRE-TRAINING WITH CHANNELVIT\nThis section delves into the integration of self-supervised learning with ChannelViT.\n26\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nE.1\nDINO\nWe use the DINO algorithm (Caron et al., 2021) for self-supervised learning. It involves a self-\ndistillation process where the student model, provided with local views of the input image, has to\nlearn from the teacher model which has the global views of the same input image.\nWe follow most of the the configuration suggested by DINO repository**. Specifically, we pre-train\nDINO with ViT-S/16 and ChannelViT-S/16 for a total of 100 epochs on ImageNet with a batch size\nof 256. The AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) is employed, and the learning rate\nwarm-up phase is set for the first 10 epochs. Given our batch size, the maximum learning rate is set\nto 0.0005, in line with recommendations from You et al. (2018). The learning rate is subsequently\ndecayed using a cosine learning rate scheduler, with a target learning rate of 10−6. Weight decay\nis applied to all parameters, excluding the biases. The initial weight decay is set to 0.04 and is\ngradually increased to 0.4 using a cosine learning rate scheduler towards the end of training. The\nDINO projection head utilized has 65536 dimensions, and batch normalization is not employed in\nthe projection head. The output temperature of the teacher network is initially set to 0.04 and is\nlinearly increased to 0.07 within the first 30 epochs. The temperature is maintained at 0.07 for the\nremainder of the training. To enhance training stability, the parameters of the output layer are frozen\nduring the first epoch.\nE.2\nLINEAR PROBING\nUpon the completion of the pre-training phase, the parameters of both ViT and ChannelViT are\nfrozen. In alignment with the methodology proposed by Caron et al. (2021), the final four layers\nof the CLS representation are concatenated to represent the image. Subsequently, a linear classi-\nfier is trained on this image representation. The training of the linear classifier is conducted using\nSGD, with a learning rate of 0.005 and a momentum value of 0.9. The learning rate is decayed in\naccordance with a cosine annealing scheduler. We train the linear classifier for 100 epochs using the\nImageNet training split. Once training is done, we report its Top-1 accuracy on the validation split.\nE.3\nRESULTS\nTable 17 showcases our results. It is noteworthy that hierarchical channel sampling is not used\nduring DINO pre-training due to its potential to introduce additional instability to the self-distillation\nobjective. However, we observe that DINO-pretrained ViT inherently provides superior channel\nrobustness. Compared to the supervised ViT-S/16, it achieves 64.34 on the red-only evaluation,\nwhich is 34.95 better than its supervised version. Furthermore, the integration of DINO-pretraining\nwith ChannelViT consistently enhances performance across all evaluations, bridging the gap towards\nthe expert DINO model that is pre-trained on each individual channel.\n**https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino\n27\n",

Caccivio3\n1 – University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI-PVLab), Mendrisio, Switzerland\n2 – Fernfachhochschule Schweiz (FFHS), Zürich, Switzerland\nmail: danuta.paraficz@ffhs.ch\nMotivation \nMultispectral imaging has diverse applications, including artwork analysis, weather forecasting, and more. The full potential of multispectral imaging in fault detection for pho\ntovoltaic (PV) modules using artificial intelligence (AI) remains underexplored. Previous efforts have only combined one imaging technique with AI for fault detection in PV mo\ndules.\nThis study aims to develop a methodology for automatic identification of failure modes in PV modules using nine-channel multispectral images. The approach integrates m\nultiple imaging techniques—visual image (VI), electroluminescence (EL), and ultraviolet fluorescence (UVf)—to detect a broader range of failure modes. This method improves\n detection of issues in modules exposed to aging in real-world conditions or accelerated stress testing. The integrated approach promises faster and more accurate detection \nof potential problems compared to single-image analysis.\nThe study also seeks to predict the electrical performance of PV modules using AI-driven analysis of multispectral images.\nMulti-Spectral Image Capturing\nVisual Image Setup:\n2 flash units and Rectangular soft boxes  positioned at a 45° angle for even light distribution\nLight in visual spectrum from the module\nElectroluminescence Image Setup:\nA power supply connected to PV module\nIR emissions from the cells\nUltaviolet Fluorescence Image Setup:\n4 UV lamps (emitting at 365 nm) positioned at a 45° angle \nA UV filter (high pass) to eliminate UV reflections \nWhen UV light (high energy) is absorbed by degradation by products of polymeric materials, which may have fluorescence effect, they emit photons in the visible range (lower\n energy)\nExample: \nA cell crack and damaged metallization (at the rear side of the cell) are visible in the EL image \nUVf image confirms there is only one cell crack (oxygen bleaching on the cell crack area)\nUsing multispectral image like in this case gives possibility to separate damaged metallisation and cell crack without any hesitation.\nPreliminary Results\nThe classification model, ChannelViT, was trained on the Duramat dataset [1] and tested o\nn the Infinity dataset [2]. This means the model was trained on different technologies than \nthose used for classification prediction. Despite the model never having encountered imag\nes from the Infinity dataset during training, it achieved an impressive prediction accuracy o\nf 94.4%. \nThe work is supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. \nFigure 1. (top) Schematic view of visual inspection (VI), electroluminescence (EL) and ultraviolet fluorescence (UVf) setups. (bottom) VI, EL,\n and UVf images of an IBC module after a long-term outdoor exposure.\nCell Classification\nDiscoloration can be identified through both VI and UVf images, depending on sp\necific conditions such as encapsulant type. In cases where discoloration is intense\n, it may also lead to oxidation of the front metallization, which can be observed in\n the EL image (red frames in figure below). In such instances, cells are labelled wit\nh multiple failure modes.\nMethodology\nFigure 3.

RoboPV automatically performs aerial monitoring of PV plants, from optimal trajectory planning to image \nprocessing and pattern recognition for real-time fault detection and analysis. RoboPV consists of four integrated \ncomponents: boundary area detection, path planning, dynamic processing, and fault detection. To design an \noptimal flight path, aerial images of PV plants, which have been collected from experimental flights, are given as \ninputs to a developed encoder-decoder deep learning architecture to extract boundary points of PV plants \nautomatically. Then, a novel path planning algorithm is conducted by RoboPV to design an optimal flight path \nwith full coverage of whole regions of the PV plant. Aerial images are analysed in real-time during the flight by a \nhigh precise neural network trained for automatic fault detection. In this study, several decision-making and \nmaneuver algorithms were developed for various real-world flight conditions to improve the performance of \nRoboPV during an autonomous aerial inspection. RoboPV is a modular processing library that can be installed on \nany micro-computer processor with a low computational power. Moreover, supporting the MAVLink commu­\nnication protocol enables RoboPV to connect with an intelligent Pixhawk flight autopilot and navigate a wide \nrange of multi-rotors. To demonstrate the performance of RoboPV, a six degrees of freedom dynamic model of a \nmulti-rotor is developed in a SIMULINK environment with a defined aerial monitoring mission on three different \nreal megawatt-scale PV plants. The results prove that RoboPV can execute the autonomous aerial inspection with \nan overall accuracy of 93% for large-scale PV plants.   \n1. Introduction \nThe aerial inspection provides detailed information about Photo­\nvoltaic (PV) systems’ conditions in a reliable and faster way [1]. In a \ntraditional inspection, human operators have played a significant role \nduring the monitoring of PV systems [2,3]. Therefore, upon the scale of \nPV plants and the number of available operators, the inspection pro­\ncedure may take a longer time. \nThe aerial inspection techniques facilitate the faults diagnosis pro­\ncess for PV plants, especially for large-scale ones [4]. Real-time failure \ndetection and analysis are the main challenges to making aerial moni­\ntoring more cost-effective and reliable [5,6]. The failures and defects can \nbe detected on PV modules by different sensors and special instruments. \nThese failures are easily recognizable by RGB [7], Infrared (IR) [8,9], \nElectroluminescence (EL) [10], and Ultraviolet Fluorescent (UVFL) [11] \ncameras, which are mounted on the multi-rotors. For improving the \naccuracy of aerial inspection, the correlation between altitude and res­\nolution of aerial sensor and potential of failure identification on the PV \nmodules should be considered [12]. \nIn a conventional aerial inspection of PV plants, an operator uses a \nmulti-rotor to collect PV strings’ aerial images. These images are used \nfor offline post-processing analysis. However, in modern aerial moni­\ntoring, the conventional methods have been replaced with artificial in­\ntelligence (AI)-based techniques and high-precision multi-rotors in \nperiodic inspection missions of PV plants [13]. In one of these ap­\nproaches, the multi-rotor flies on an optimal path created by a Ground \n* Corresponding author at: Department of Ocean Operations and Civil Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), 6009 Ålesund, \nNorway. \nE-mail address: mohammadreza.aghaei@ntnu.no (M.

In this method, flight data are received during the \nflight, but video streams transmitted to the GCS are not analyzed in a \nreal-time. This method is called a semi-autonomous inspection, in which \nthe multi-rotor cannot perform any maneuver to improve the accuracy \nof the aerial monitoring mission. Offline data analysis is still one of the \ndisadvantages of this method, and collected images should be processed \nmanually by an operator for fault detection. \nTo design a specific multi-rotor for autonomous aerial monitoring \nand analysis of PV plants, many criteria should be considered, including \nthe ability to take-off and landing automatically [14], waypoints \nfollowing [15], and programmable flight computer. An autonomous \nsystem for aerial monitoring of PV plants has not yet been developed, \nwith desired capabilities namely, bi-directional communication with a \nwide range of different multi-rotor configurations, accurate detection of \nfailures in PV arrays with higher accuracy via deep learning models, \nguidance and control the multi-rotor in flight and plan a new trajectory. \nMoreover, the desired system can also perform all steps of aerial \nmonitoring automatically without human intervention. These steps \ninclude boundary detection of the PV plant and designing an optimal \nflight trajectory [16]. \nRecently, different convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as \nGoogleNet [17] and VGGNet [18], were developed and used in many \nreal-world applications. For instance, in an experiment, after different \nflights by using multi-rotors and collecting aerial IR images of PV \nstrings, the images were imported into image classifiers using CNN to \ndistinguish healthy modules from damage ones [19]. \nThe current study is part of a comprehensive research project entitled \n”Autonomous Monitoring and Analysis of PV systems. In one of our \nprevious works [20], an automated control system has been developed \nusing a designed multi-rotor and a GCS platform to provide accurate \ninformation on PV plants’ operating conditions. In another recent study, \nan encoder-decoder architecture of CNNs have been developed for \naccurately detecting the potentail defects on PV modules using aerial \nimages which collected through several experimental flight by multi- \nrotors [21]. \nHere, we have developed and designed a novel PV plant’s monitoring \nsoftware platform, called ”RoboPV”, for autonomous inspection of PV \nplants, along with the project development and based on the our pre­\nvious research studies [13,20,22–25]. The proposed processing platform \nenables different multi-rotors to automatically monitor large-scale PV \nplants and analyze PV systems’ performance and conditions. RoboPV is \nan intelligent data processing platform which can be installed on an on- \nboard microprocessor, e.g., RaspberryPi 4, and interacts with the 3DR \nPixhawk autopilot to command different multi-rotors. Pixhawk is a \npopular general purpose flight controller that can be installed on various \nkinds of multi-rotors for educational and commercial purposes. More­\nover, RoboPV employs improved deep learning algorithms to enhance \nthe performance of aerial inspection compared to conventional, and \nsemi-autonomous methods. The boundary detection of a PV plant is an \nessential step toward an autonomous aerial inspection. Therefore, an \nimproved encoder-decoder architecture is trained with a designed fully \nconvolutional network (FCN) as a backbone to detect the PV plant’s \nboundary points accurately. Furthermore, for automatic fault detection, \nthe real-time collected images are analyzed by RoboPV to localize po­\ntential faults on PV modules. For this purpose, RoboPV uses an accurate \ntrained image segmentation model to predict the exact position of any \ntype of failure on PV modules in a pixel-level accuracy. \nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces RoboPV and \nprovides detailed information about its construction and how it pro­\ncesses flight data and executes decision-making during the aerial in­\nspection mission. Section 3 presents the dynamic modeling of the multi- \nrotor used in the simulation verification. Finally, the results and per­\nformance verifications of RoboPV in an autonomous aerial monitoring \nof three PV plants are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 draws some \nFig. 1.

RoboPV Software Platform \nRecent technology advancement of multi-rotors, flight controllers \nand remote sensing has led to a significant development in intelligent \nmonitoring techniques [24]. RoboPV is the key processing core of the \non-board microprocessor installed on the aerial robot to navigate the \nmulti-rotor during the flight and analyze the data online to increase the \nefficiency of the aerial monitoring of PV plants compared to traditional \napproaches. RoboPV can upgrade any multi-rotor with a different in­\ntelligence level to inspect entire strings in a PV plant automatically, from \npath planning and image collection to online image processing for \nautomatic failure detection, flight data analysis, and decision-making \nfor remedial actions. \nTo perform an aerial monitoring of a large-scale PV plant accurately, \nit is necessary to develop an intelligent data processing and decision- \nmaking unit with distinctive capabilities consisting of I) receiving on­\nline flight parameters from the sensors installed on the multi-rotors, II) \nbeing able to navigate different configurations of multi-rotors, e.g., \nQuad-rotors and Hexa-rotors, III) online image processing for AI-based \nfault detection, IV) smart decision-making for remedial maneuver dur­\ning the inspection mission, V) optimal flight trajectory planning to cover \nthe whole area of the PV plant without any blind spot, VI) being able to \ndetect accurately different types of defects and failures on PV modules \naccording with available sensors and instruments. \nThe proposed RoboPV is an automated and integrated embedded \nsoftware package, including four units, boundary detection, path plan­\nning, fault detection, and dynamic processing. As can be observed in \nFig. 1, these four units perform the whole procedure of PV plant moni­\ntoring in six phases:  \n1. Boundary Detection: In a pre-flight step, RoboPV extracts the \nboundary area of the PV plant by an accurate trained encoder- \ndecoder network based on an FCN.  \n2. Path Planning: The path planning algorithm generates an optimal \nflight path with the shortest total distance to guarantee the full \ncoverage of entire PV plant’s areas. This path is designed according \nwith the multi-rotor’s capabilities, such as flight endurance and \nmaneuverability. \n3. Dynamic Processing: During the aerial inspection, the flight com­\nputer of the multi-rotor interacts with the on-board microprocessor \non which RoboPV has been installed. RoboPV monitors all flight data \nsuch as velocity, position, orientation, battery voltage, and motors’ \nstatus to take remedial action upon defined decision-making \nalgorithms. \n4. Fault Detection: The collected video stream of PV modules is pro­\ncessed online in the on-board microprocessor by the fault detection \nunit to extract feature maps of target defects and failures on the PV \nmodules for an accurate position localization.  \n5. Maneuvering: During the mission, whenever any failure is detected \non the PV modules, RoboPV sends a control signal to Pixhawk to \nnavigate the multi-rotor to maneuver on the possibly faulty region \nfor further investigations.  \n6. Decision-Making: After each maneuvering process, the dynamic \nprocessing examines the multi-rotor’s ability to complete the mission \nbecause of the battery drain. In the case of necessity, an optimal path \nis re-planned for the rest of the mission. \nThe outputs of RoboPV are summarized as follows:  \n1. RoboPV uses an encoder-decoder deep learning architecture which is \ntrained by a novel dataset of PV plants’ aerial images to extract the \nboundary area of PV plants.  \n2. A set of optimal flight waypoints are generated by an intelligent path \nplanning algorithm that ensures full coverage of the PV strings by the \nmulti-rotor’s and based on the Field of View (FoV) of the sensors on- \nboard.  \n3. All multi-rotor’s flight parameters, e.g., flight endurance, position, \nattitude, and altitude, are received and processed in real-time by \nRoboPV for fast and precise decision-making. \n4. RoboPV is equipped with a well-trained FCN model to localize po­\ntential defects and failures on PV modules at pixels level. The images \nare analyzed online during the flight to generate a map of defects’ \nposition at the end of the mission. \n5. RoboPV is well compatible with Pixhawk autopilot through MAV­\nLink communication protocol. This feature enables RoboPV to be \nadaptable with different types of aerial robots. \n2.1. Boundary Detection \nAs mentioned earlier, having the boundary area is a crucial step in an \nautonomous aerial monitoring process especially in generating an \noptimal covering path. One popular approach for boundary extraction is \nto follow the Mask-RCNN structure in which the spatial resolution of the \ninput is down-sampled, and lower resolution features map are obtained \nwith high efficiency among classes. Up-sampling is then performed by \ntransposing convolutions into a full-resolution segmentation map. In \nthis regard, RoboPV presents an encoder-decoder deep model with a \nmodified FCN backbone as an encoder part to determine the boundary of \na PV plant at pixel-level. This is an instance segmentation problem. By \nthis technique, each pixel is labeled to determine whether that pixel \nbelongs to the PV string’s aerial image. The structure of the proposed \nnetwork is depicted in Fig. 2. To have an accurate image segmentation \nmodel, data preparation is a primary step. Accordingly, a developed \ndataset of aerial images of large-scale PV plants, entitled ”Amir”, was \npresented elsewhere [26]. Amir consists of 3584 aerial images of PV \nplants from twelve countries. \nIn this research, the encoder network is designed by removing all \nfully connected layers and freezing the two last layers with initial \nImageNet weights. Furthermore, we considered a symmetric configu­\nration in order to have the same number of layers, ζ for encoder and \ndecoder. The input and output dimensions for the encoder layer Ξi and \nthe decoder layer Πi are as follows [27]: \n{\nΞi : Rdi−1→Rd\ni\nΠi : Rd\ni →Rdi−1\n(1) \nFig. 2.

Precisely, for merging the information from \ninput images, encoder concatenates the extracted feature maps from \neach alternating layer (starting from input) to the corresponding output \nfeatures maps of host branch. More specifically, the l-th layer input \nsignal for the encoder layer comes from qi−1 number of input channels: \nξi−1 =\n[\nξi−1T\n1\n⋯ξi−1T\nqi−1\n]T\n∈Rdi−1\n(2)  \nwhere ξi−1T\n1\n∈Rmi−1 refers to the i-th channel input with the dimension \nmi−1. Therefore, the overall input dimension is given by di−1 : mi−1qi−1. \nThen, the i-th layer encoder generates qi channel output using the \nconvolution operation: \nξi\nj = σ\n(\nτiT ∑\nqi−1\nk=1\n(\nξi−1\nk\n⊙f i\nj,k\n) )\n,\nj ∈[qi]\n(3)  \nwhere ξi\nj ∈Rmi refers to the j-th channel output after the convolutional \nfiltering with the r filters fi\nj,k ∈Rr and pooling operation τiT ∈Rmi ×\nRmi−1, σ(.) denotes the element wise rectified linear unit (ReLU), and ⊙is \nthe convolution via periodic boundary condition to avoid special \ntreatment of the convolution at the boundary. Our decoder network \nreceives the encoder produced hybrid image as input and runs it through \nsequence of convolution and ReLU layers (except the last layer which \ndoes not include ReLU) to recover the concealed representation of input \nimage. \nIn practice, the encoder receives aerial images of PV plants and their \nmasks as inputs and calculates low-resolution feature maps through \nconvolutional operations. Later on, the features are imported into the \ndecoder part of the network to up-sampling is executed for the \nreconstruction of images with extracted PV plants. The decoder part of \nthe proposed encoder-decoder network is the critical aspect, which \nprovides significant practical advantages regarding enhancing boundary \ndetection and minimizing the total network size to enable end-to-end \ntraining. \nTo evaluate the output of each layer of the proposed encoder-decoder \nnetwork during the training, two-dimensional filters learned by the \nmodel can be visualized to discover what features are detected for a \ngiven PV plant’s image. The primary layers in Fig. 2 are responsible for \nextracting details from the input image. The first layer of the trained \nmodel consists of 64 images corresponding to 64 defined filters in this \nlayer. Each filter is responsible for extracting one specific feature. For \ninstance, some filters in Fig. 3 analyzes the image to understand the \nbackground; other filters try to operate high-level processing, e.g., edge \ndetection. \nAs we move towards the network’s end layers, more general features \nare captured from the input image. To train and evaluate the model, \n80% of total images are dedicated randomly to the training step, and the \nrest of the images are used for examining the trained model’s perfor­\nmance in predicting unseen data with loss and accuracy index. The ac­\ncuracy of training and testing processes are 97.61% and 96.99%, \nrespectively [26]. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the trained network’s pre­\ndiction is accurate enough in boundary detection on three given PV \nplants. The final predicted image consists of 240 × 320 pixels with a \npixel intensity between 0 and 255. The model intends to set the pixels’ \nintensity close to 255 for pixels it predicts that belong to the area of the \nPV plant. Therefore, some regions of the output image have grey color. \nFor this purpose, a threshold is determined to filter the pixels with a \nvalue greater than a specific value to distinguish the boundaries clearly. \nFor instance, the pixels with a value of more than 125 belong to the \nboundary of the PV plant. \nIn an aerial monitoring mission, it is necessary to calculate an \nFig. 5.

Moradi Sizkouhi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nEnergy Conversion and Management 254 (2022) 115217\n6\naccurate set of waypoints in order to be sent to an aerial robot. For this \npurpose, the path planning algorithm needs a precise estimation of the \nboundary of the PV plant. So, if the boundary extraction system detects \nan arbitrary area as the area of PV plants, the path planner will make a \nmistake in its flight route making, and the aerial monitoring mission will \nfail. To solve this problem, the encoder-decoder is a suitable replace­\nment for the classical image processing approaches in boundary detec­\ntion. This method is very robust and has a reliable performance in facing \ndifferent PV plants. \n2.2. Path Planning \nIn an autonomous aerial monitoring of a PV plant, the multi-rotor \nmust fly over a set of waypoints which cover whole area of PV plant. \nFurthermore, it is essential to have a specific path planning algorithm to \ncreate an optimal path for PV plants’ aerial monitoring missions. An \noptimal path is defined as a flight path by which the multi-rotor can \ninspect all PV modules in the shortest possible distance without blind \nspots in the camera’s FoV, especially near the border regions. To reach \nthis goal, the path planning algorithm considers some important pa­\nrameters, including the dimension of each PV string and the entire PV \nplant, the distance between every two PV strings, flight altitude, and the \ncameras’ FoV mounted on multi-rotor. The path planning’s main \nobjective is to generate the shortest possible path on a given PV plant to \nreduce the time of the aerial inspection. Accordingly, the first step is to \nextract the PV plants’ boundary area using the deep neural network \nmethod described in the previous section. Fig. 5 shows the output curves \nof boundary detection step for three different PV plants. \nFig. 6 shows the coverage area by multi-rotor based on the FoV and \nresolution camera on-board as well as the essential parameters used for \npath planning. Due to 90◦FoV of the aerial camera used in this exper­\niment, the multi-rotor covers an 30 × 30 m2 area on the ground by flying \nat a fixed 15m altitude. Consequently, the number of guidelines of the \ndesired path (see Fig. 7) is calculated by dividing the width of the plant \nby twice the flight altitude, Nr = W/(2 × H), where Nr is the number of \nguidelines of the path, W is the PV plant’s width, and H is the flight \naltitude. One of the most concerning factors in an autonomous path \nplanning mission is to keep an appropriate distance between every two \nlines of the designed trajectory. For this purpose, (2 × H) −doverlap is \nconsidered as yadd to each line of the path. During the path planning, \ndoverlap plays a critical role in the performance of RoboPV in fault \ndetection process. \nNext, the guidelines are created and illustrated in Fig. 7 (b) by adding \nFig. 7. The final designed trajectory by the intersection of the boundary area and guide lines for a sample PV plant.  \nFig. 8.

Finally, the intersection points \nare calculated for a given PV plant and depicted as green points in Fig. 7 \n(c). The final calculated flight trajectories are shown with red lines on \nthese PV plants in Fig. 8. \nDifferent paths with distinctive total distance can be achieved by \nrotating a PV plant’s image with different looking angle. In this regard, \nbest looking angle selection is crucial for achieving an optimal trajec­\ntory. Therefore, the aerial images of PV plants are rotated by employing \na set of different rotation angles. Later on, the proposed path planning \nalgorithm is conducted on each PV plant’s rotated image, and the new \npath’s length is calculated. Moreover, a length calibration process is \nrequired. During the calibration, 20◦is selected as the reference, and the \nratio of the total amount of image’s pixels of other rotation angles on the \ntotal amount of the reference image’s pixels is calculated as the cali­\nbration factor. Table 1 presents the results of the calibration step. \nAs mentioned before, the generated optimal path guarantees the full \ncoverage of all areas of the PV plant by the multi-rotors and based on the \nFoV of cameras on-board, specifically corner regions. Fig. 9 shows three \ncoverage maps by the multi-rotor during the flight on the proposed \noptimal paths. As shown in this Figure, blue points illustrate the way­\npoints that the multi-rotor passes at each time step (1 second) with a \nconstant forward speed of 5m/s from the start point to the endpoint of \neach line. Besides, red points show the outputs of the path planning \nalgorithm. Since the multi-rotor flies at a 15 m altitude in the direction of \nthe line between two waypoints, it covers a region with an area of \n900 m2 with its 90◦FoV and is shown with green squares in Fig. 9. In an \nefficient and optimal flight trajectory for aerial inspection of a PV plant, \nthe cameras mounted on multi-rotor must cover the whole environment \nand PV strings. This complete coverage is shown with intersections of \ngreen squares across the developed path. \nThe main objective of the control block is to provide the desired \nwaypoint in different conditions of the flight. In the following, these \ndifferent conditions are listed.  \n1. Home mode: At this mode, the multi-rotor is at home position and \nshould take off and fly to the first waypoint. Therefore, the desired \nposition in this situation is the first waypoint of the pre-planned \noptimal trajectory. \nFig. 9. The coverage maps of the multi-rotor with designed flight trajectory on three sample PV plants.  \nFig. 10. The schematic of the dynamic processing unit.  \nA.M. Moradi Sizkouhi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nEnergy Conversion and Management 254 (2022) 115217\n8\n2. Flight mode: At this mode, the multi-rotor flies over the designed \npath. The desired position is the waypoint ahead and is changed to \nthe next one just when the multi-rotor gets closer to this point from a \nspecified limit.  \n3. Maneuver mode: This mode would be activated when the multi- \nrotor detects a probable fault on PV arrays. At this moment, the \nmulti-rotor stops first, and then, the desired position is the same \nlocation with lower altitude (descent to 5m relative height) for 60 \nseconds hovering and initiating the detailed monitoring. After that, \nthe multi-rotor returns to its previous height, and the decision- \nmaking decides the multi-rotor’s ability to complete the current \npath or need a new optimal trajectory. \n2.3. Dynamic Processing \nAfter the path planning calculates the optimal flight waypoints, \nRoboPV transmits the waypoints to the Pixhawk flight management \nsystem through an established MAVLink application programming \ninterface (API). APIs allow RoboPV as a client to communicate with \nPixhawk with a specific protocol. The dynamic processing includes three \nmain sub-systems with defined roles during the aerial monitoring of PV \nplants. The schematic of the dynamic processing is shown in Fig. 10. \nThe dynamic processing investigates the multi-rotor’s flight data to \ncommand the multi-rotor for fast decision-making during the flight. \nFlight data include position, velocity, battery percentage, and collected \nimages of PV strings. The dynamic processing receives data from the \nPixhawk and the fault detection in order to decide the best action ac­\ncording to the current state of the robot. As illustrated in Fig. 11, this \nunit also interacts with other components of RoboPV and the Pixhawk \nflight controller. Accordingly, after investigating the fault detection, if \nthere is one or several defects on PV modules in the multi-rotor’s FoV, \nthe dynamic processing is responsible for executing the maneuver ac­\ntion, including a set of actions for precise inspection of the target region. \nAfter each monitoring maneuver, the decision-making, a sub-system \nof the dynamic processing, is called up to analyze the flight condition \nwith algorithms developed for fast decision-making. The decision- \nmaking is responsible for deciding whether the multi-rotor can com­\nplete the mission on the current flight path. Because of the battery drain \nduring the maneuvering phase, it is possible that the required flight time \nto pass the remained trajectory is longer than the multi-rotor’s available \nflight time. Consequently, the path planning is called by the decision- \nmaking to design a new optimal path based on the current position of \nthe multi-rotor. \n2.3.1. Maneuvering \nAfter the fault detection determines the possibility of damages on the \nPV modules, the maneuver command is issued. Maneuver actions are \ndefined as any change in multi-rotor’s states for a careful investigation \nof the target area in PV strings. For example, whenever the multi-rotor \nreceives the stop command from the decision-making, it hovers over \nthat specific point, and then reduces its altitude to a certain pre-set \naltitude and sends captured aerial images of PV strings to the fault \ndetection for detailed analysis. Subsequently, it returns to the previous \naltitude to continue the mission. This process is depicted in Fig. 11. \nThe structure of the maneuvering is organized and described in Al­\ngorithm1. If the flag of fault is on, the following situations can be \nconsidered during an aerial inspection of the PV plant. First, the damage \nis specified, and the multi-rotor is at the beginning of the maneuvering \nprocess (point 1). Next, the multi-rotor reduces its altitude to become \ncloser to the affected PV modules (point 2). At this phase, the multi-rotor \nhovers on the detected area at a new altitude to analyze the region \nprecisely. Finally, the multi-rotor returns to its previous flight altitude \nFig. 11. The set of defined actions for the maneuvering process.  \nA.M. Moradi Sizkouhi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nEnergy Conversion and Management 254 (2022) 115217\n9\nafter completing the failure detection on the affected PV module and \nwaits for new commands from RoboPV (point 3). \n2.3.2. Decision-Making \nDuring the autonomous aerial monitoring, decision making plays a \nsignificant role in completing the mission. This unit surveys the multi- \nrotor’s ability after each maneuver, whether it can continue the mission \non the current path or not. If the multi-rotor’s remained endurance is \nless than the required flight time, a new optimal path is designed by the \npath planning unit. To design a new trajectory, the flight altitude is \nincreased one level to increase the coverage area of the multi-rotor’s FoV \non the ground. For example, if the multi-rotor cannot complete the aerial \ninspection at the current 15 m altitudes, the altitude will be increased to \n16 m, and the path planning is executed. Although this increase in alti­\ntude leads to a decrease in resolution of PV modules’ images, the multi- \nrotor can cover 124 m2 more on the ground. If the new altitude is \nfeasible, decision-making sends the waypoints to the Pixhawk autopilot \nwith a MAVLink communication protocol. On the other hand, if RoboPV \nencounters any unseen situation during the mission, an emergency \nlanding scenario is defined for the multi-rotor to prevent serious dam­\nages. The architecture of the decision-making is explained in \nAlgorithm2. \n2.4. Fault Detection \nOnce the multi-rotor begins to fly over the PV plant, the fault \ndetection unit starts to analyze the PV module’s aerial images. Different \ncameras are available with various frames per second rate for image \ncollection. In this experiment, the Nikon 1-V1 RGB camera is chosen \nwith 30 frames per second. To reduce the computation power of image \nprocessing for fault detection just three frames are analyzed per second. \nOn the other hand, the multi-rotor flies at a constant 5 m/s cruise \nvelocity and moves 5m forward per second. Therefore, while fault \ndetection unit analyzes the frames, the multi-rotor has moved 5 meters \nfrom its place in the previous 1 second time step. As Fig. 12 shows, the \ndisplacement of the multi-rotor during the image processing by fault \ndetection on the microprocessor has no effect on reducing the accuracy \nof the RoboPV in the automatic fault detection, and there is sufficient \noverlap (20 × 30m2) between the frames recorded in the previous and \ncurrent time step. \nAs an example, The procedure of bird’s drops detection is as follows. \nAlgorithm2: The structure of the decision-makeing \nAlgorithm1: The structure of the maneuvering \nA.M.

The \naerial images commonly cover two or three PV strings depending on the \nflight’s altitude and FoV, of the RGB sensors onboard. Each string con­\ntains a number of series-connected PV modules. The module extractor \nrecognizes modules with some image processing techniques (e.g. canny \nedge detection). Each module is divided into three zones using \nmorphological transformations since the PV modules consist of six rows \nof solar cells connected in series and parallel. Each two rows has been \nconnected a bypass diode in parallel to circumvent the destructive ef­\nfects of shading. Zone definition is a significant information to help \ndecision-making algorithm to prioritize the modules with higher failure \nrisk. The zone definition is conducted for every extracted modules. \nThe feature maps of images and masks are extracted first through the \nencoder part based on the VGG16 modified model. The FCN structure is \nused in this research, adjusts the first layer dimensions, which is called \nthe input layer and is shown as xi, according to the dimensions of the \ninput image to the model. The dimension of the input images is equal to \n640 (width), 480 (height), and 3 (depth of the color channel). Each layer \naccompanies with an activation map mc\ni . The decoder unit uses a seg­\nmentation map G(mc\ni , ∅s), where ∅s is the segmentation network \nparameter. Later, some convolutional layers are used in encoder unit to \nincrease the dimension of each layer. In this regard, the two-dimensional \nmatrix of the image and the mask enter the network as inputs. Subse­\nquently, a reduced dimension matrix is considered as a kernel with \ndimension of (3 × 3). This kernel starts moving on the image from the \ntop-left to right-down. At each step, elements of the image’s matrix, \nwhich are covered by the filter matrix, are converted to a new element of \nthe next layer of the model during a convolutional operation. This \nprocess continues until the filter covers all the elements of the image \nmatrix. \nIn the next step, the features are imported into the decoder part of the \nnetwork to up-sampling is executed for the reconstruction of images \nwith detected bird’s dropping. The decoder part of the proposed \nencoder-decoder network is the key aspect that provides great practical \nadvantages regarding enhancing drop segmentation. Finally, the trained \nnetwork’s output is a binary image in which pixels predicted to belong to \nthe multi-rotor’s dropping have 255 value, and the rest of the pixels have \n0 value. \nTo prepare a proper dataset for bird’s dropping segmentation, many \nflight operations have been conducted, and a collection of aerial images \nhave been collected. The dataset contains images of birds dropping in \ndifferent positions and orientations on PV modules. The designed fully \nconvolutional model has been trained to detect common failures and \ndefects, including bird’s dropping. To evaluate the network perfor­\nmance, we considered some well-known performance measures for \ninstance segmentation problems, namely, Dice (F1) score, Jaccard (J) or \nIntersection-Over-Union (IoU) score and pixel accuracy. The Jaccard \nscore is a common used metric in segmentation problems. This index is \ndefined as the area of overlap region between the predicted segmenta­\ntion object and the annotated mask divided by the union area of pre­\ndicted object and the annotated mask. For two sets segmentation object \n(S) and ground truth (G), this index is defined as Eq.(4). \nJ(S, G) = |S⋂G|\n|S⋃G| =\n|S⋂G|\n|S| + |G| −|S⋂G|\n(4) \nIn pixel space of an image, Eq.(4) is defined in a non-discrete object \nform as: \nFig. 12.

To calculate the \npixel accuracy, first, it is necessary to find four values of each predicted \nimage, TP,FP,TN, and FN, true positive, false positive, true negative, and \nfalse negative values. TP is defined as pixels classified correctly as the \ntarget class, FP is defined as pixels classified incorrectly as the target \nclass, TN is defined as pixels classified correctly as not target class, and \nFN is defined as pixels classified incorrectly as not target class. The pixel \naccuracy is obtained using Eq. 6. \naccuracy =\nTP + TN\nTP + TN + FP + FN\n(6) \nThe neural network’s training is performed in two stages. First, im­\nages’ down-sampling operation is executed to calculate low-resolution \nfeature maps; second, up-sampling operation is performed to recon­\nstruct the image with desired region of the potential bird’s drops. The \nbase learning rate for network training is set at 0.0005. The system re­\nports the rates of loss and accuracy of the training and validation at each \nstage. Extracted modules require some pre-processing operations to get \nready for the training step. Besides, each module is examined upon the \npossibility of the existence of bird’s drops on PV modules. Moreover, as \nit was illustrated in Fig. 5, it is necessary to feed the model with different \nimages of PV modules from various perspectives. The training is \nexecuted in 23 epochs. The batch size 32 is selected, and images are \nshuffled to diverse images in each batch. As a loss function, we use a \nbinary cross entropy. The training is performed on Colab cloud-base \nGPU, which is provided by Google. Finally, for testing the \nperformance of the trained model, extracted modules of PV strings are \ngiven to the encoder-decoder model. The outputs are shown in Fig. 13. \nAs presented in Table 2, the trained model can determine the accu­\nrate location of multi-rotor’s dropping on PV modules with an average \naccuracy of 93.33% for testing data that remained unseen during the \ntraining stage. If the PV module is determined as a damaged one, the \npanel’s location will be reported to the dynamic processing unit. Fig. 13 \ndemonstrates the predicted results for potential birds’ dropping on three \nsample given PV modules. \n3. RoboPV’s Performance Validation \nIn order to validate RoboPV’s performance in an aerial inspection, \ncomprehensive processor in the loop (PIL) tests have been conducted. To \nperform this PIL simulations, Pixhawk 4, Holybro autopilot is employed, \nas a processor, to control and navigate the multi-rotor on the desired \ntrajectories calculated by RoboPV. Besides, this processor is located in \nthe loop of RoboPV and flight simulation codes which have been run on \na personal computer (PC) with specifications listed in Table 3. Fig. 10 \nindicates that there are three subsystems contains RoboPV platform, \nPixhawk and a multi-rotor. In PIL test all these subsystems except Pix­\nhawk autopilot are simulated on a PC. Date transmission between Pix­\nhawk flight controller and RoboPV and muti-rotor simulations on the PC \nis done through an established MAVLink communication protocol. \nWhile the simulation is running, Pixhawk takes simulated measurements \nof the multi-rotor from PC via MAVLink to compute the guidance and \ncontrol signals required for keeping the aerial robot on the desired path. \nThe PC also takes the commands via MAVLink protocol and executes \nthem on the simulated multi-rotor. In the following, the dynamic model \nof multi-rotor and the control system will be explained. \n3.1. Multi-rotor Dynamical Modeling \nFor model based design of control system, first requirement is the \nmathematical dynamic model of the plant which is a multi-rotor, in this \npaper. Multi-rotors and especially quad-rotors are a highly non-linear, \nunder-actuated, and intrinsically unstable system which are used as a \ntest case of control system design in several researches [28]. \nInertial and body frames and its associated coordinate systems are \nshown in Fig. 14. All velocity and position vectors in this section are \ndescribed in these two coordinate systems. The 6-DOF rotational and \ntranslational equations of motion of a multi-rotor (as a case of muti- \nrotors) is derived based on the Euler-Newton formulas [30] as: \nTable 2 \nThe performance measurements of the FCN with defined metrics.  \nActivations \nPixel Accuracy \nJaccard (IoU) Score \nDice (F1) Score \nTanH \n0.9  \n0.4  \n0.61  \nELU \n0.93  \n0.4  \n0.63  \nSigmoid \n0.95  \n0.46  \n0.62   \nTable 3 \nSpecifications of PC used as a processing unit for aerial monitoring \nsimulation.  \nItems \nDescription \nCPU \nIntel R Processor \nRAM \n16 GB \nOperating System (OS) \nWindows 10  \nFig. 14.

As can be seen in this figure \nand Eq.(8), the rotational dynamics are independent of translational \nones but not vice versa.

Simulation and Results \nIn order to show the accuracy of RoboPV’s performance in an \nautonomous aerial monitoring of a PV plant, it is necessary to simulate \nthe real world conditions in the loop of Pixhawk autopilot processor as \nPIL tests. For this purpose, as mentioned in previous sections, firstly, the \nboundary detection unit extracts the PV plants’ boundary points using a \ntrained deep neural network. Then, these points enter the path planning \nunit as inputs. The trajectory planning unit, by considering various pa­\nrameters such as the length and width of the PV plant, the dimensions of \nthe panels, the FoV of the camera, and the velocity and altitude of the \nmulti-rotor, designs an optimal path to cover the whole PV plant with \nminmum path length. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the lines of the \ndesigned trajectory will have the least amount of distance and the \nTable 6 \nQuadrotor controller gain.  \nParameters \nKz  \nKw  \nKϕ  \nKp  \nKθ  \nKq  \nKψ  \nKr  \nKu  \nKv  \nValue \n3.4  \n2.5  \n6.87  \n0.05  \n6.87  \n0.05  \n6.8  \n0.09  \n0.23  \n0.22   \nFig. 16.

In Fig. 19, three samples of optimal routes, designed by trajectory \nplanning unit for three PV plants, are indicated. The generated paths \nwhich have shown in Fig. 19, shows that developed trajectory planning \nunit is not only applicable in rectangular PV plants, but also can be used \nin irregular shapes PV plants such as the first and third ones. \nFor validation of RoboPV performance in the mentioned routes, \nprocessor in the loop (PIL) tests are performed respecting the architec­\nture indicated in Fig. 20. All RoboPV functions including boundary \ndetection, path planning, dynamic processing as well as path following \nguidance and the multi-rotor dynamic model are simulated in real time, \nin the computer environment, and in the loop of pixhawk flight pro­\ncessor. The interface of computer environment and pixhawk flight \nprocessor is done through the MAVLink API. Here, pixhawk’s role is to \nreceive the waypoints as a set of MAVLink messages and returns motor \nand actuator commands applied to the simulated multi-rotor on the \ncomputer. \nIn Table 7, some settings which have impact on the accuracy of the \nmission are introduced. Here, three different altitudes are introduced. \nFlight altitude is the height that multi-rotor is firstly planned to fly at. \nMaximum allowable altitude is the maximum altitude to identify the \ndesired defect without reducing the accuracy of detection. In the cases of \npath replanning and increasing the flight altitude, maximum allowable \naltitude is the upper limit. The third altitude is maneuver altitude at \nwhich the multi-rotor flies during the hovering part (maneuver time) of \nmaneuvering phase. Capturing images from this altitude in the interval \nof maneuver time (see Table 7) guarantees the sufficient resolution and \naccuracy for detection of suspected fault. \nFigs. 21 show the PIL simulation trajectories of sample routes pre­\nsented in Figs. 19. It is obvious that the multi-rotor starts to fly from take \noff point along the preplanned paths. It keeps flying until faces with a \npotential fault. After the fault detection unit has determined the po­\ntential faults on the PV modules, the dynamic processing unit commands \nthe multi-rotor to reduce its velocity and stop at the fault detected point. \nLater on, the multi-rotor decreases its altitude from 15m to 5m, and \nhovers over the point for 60s, while sends the video stream to RoboPV in \nreal-time for detailed investigation. At this time, the fault detection in­\nvestigates the area more precisely. This procedure can be seen in some \npoints in Figs. 21 where the multi-rotor has reduced its altitude. At the \nend of 60s, the multi-rotor returns to the prior altitude automatically and \nwaits for the next command from the RoboPV. Three videos of these \nmissions are also available as supplementary information. All events \ndescribed above can be seen in these videos[33–35]. \nAfter the maneuvering process completed, the dynamic processing \nunit calls the decision-making unit to determine whether the multi-rotor \ncan continue the inspection mission on the current path based on its \navailable flight endurance (Battery state of charge). If the multi-rotor \ncannot complete the mission on the current waypoints successfully, a \nnew flight path is designed based on the mentioned criteria. The new \npath’s start point will be the same as current position of the multi-rotor \nbut with higher altitude. Finally, the new trajectory points are sent to the \npath following guidance to feed the Pixhawk through the MAVLink API \nprotocol. This path replanning procedure can be seen just after the third \nfault detected point of PV plant number 3 monitoring mission in Fig. 21 \n(c). \nVideo [33] shows the animation of the multi-rotor flight over the \nwhole trajectory of first PV plant (Fig. 21 (a)) and fault detection ma­\nneuver as well as states variables changes. It can be seen that the RoboPV \nhas kept the altitude of multi-rotor at the height of 15 meters except \nwhen a fault has been detected about 340th second of the flight. At this \nFig. 20.

After that, it has returned to the preplanned altitude \n(15m). The controller tried to hold the yaw angle constant during the \nflight, however in maneuver time, it has faced with disturbances. Tilt \nangles (ϕ and θ) has varied to vector the multi-rotor total thrust toward \nthe direction of the path. As it is seen, these variables has changed when \nthe multi-rotor altered the direction of the path and when it has \nmaneuvered to reduce the altitude. Fig. 22 concentrates on the period of \nmulti-rotor maneuver and indicates all control inputs and state variables \nincluding the commanded thrust and moments and their associated ro­\ntors’ angular speeds as well as linear and angular velocities and atti­\ntudes. As indicated in Fig. 22 variations of the thrust and multi-rotor \nmoment about the three principle axis at the beginning of the maneu­\nver and when it has returned to the previous altitude are considerable. \nSame as [33], in video [34] we can see the animation of multi-rotor \nduring the monitoring of PV plant number 2. In this flight two different \nfaults has been detected. In both of them, the multi-rotor has flown \ndown to the altitude of 5 meters to concentrate on the faults and send \nmore reliable images to the fault detection unit. Fig. 23 (a) and (b) \npresents the flight state variables, rotor speeds and thrust and moments \nduring these two maneuvers. Zero angular and linear velocities in both \nmaneuvers (Figs. 23 (a) and (b)), when the multi-rotor has flown down, \nshows that it has been in stationary situations and thus could capture \nimages without any blurring due to the camera motion. \nOne question that may arise is why before and after maneuver (see \nlinear velocity graphs in Figs. 23 (a) and (b)), the multi-rotor had ve­\nlocities (some times negative) along both longitudinal and lateral body \ncoordinate axis denoted by u and v, respectively. Generally, it is ex­\npected that the forward flight velocity will be positive and along lon­\ngitudinal direction (expected to have just positive u). This is due to the \nfact that in these missions we control and fix the yaw angle of multi- \nrotor for preventing the direction change of captured images and \nsimpler compiling and precise locating the possible faults. Then, if we fix \nthe yaw angle during the flight, multi-rotor needs to both bank (altering \nϕ angle) and pitch (altering θ angle) to vector the thrust along the path \nline, and therefore it may have both u and v during the flight. In this \nregard, some times, the multi-rotor needs to fly backward and therefore \nit has negative u or v in such situations (see linear velocity graphs in \nFigs. 23 (a) and (b)). In contrast, in conventional forward flight, the \nmulti-rotor changes the yaw angle to head itself toward the path line. \nThen in such forward flights, we mostly have just positive velocity in \nlongitudinal coordinate (u). \nVideo [35] shows the whole flight of multi-rotor over PV plant \nnumber 3. While the video is played, red points in Euler angles and \naltitude plot indicates the exact variables, during the flight. The parallel \nlines of trajectory which in some places are connected by oblique lines, \nshows that the trajectory planning unit can satisfactorily generate the \npaths with minimum length and maximum coverage. After take off and \ntravelling to the first point, multi-rotor has flown with constant altitude \nalong the generated path, until it encountered the first possible fault at \nabout 105th second. The multi-rotor has flown down at the same point to \nthe height of 5 meters and remained at stationary situation for 60 sec­\nonds. During this maneuver, the camera took precise images from \npossible fault. After that, multi-rotor returned to the previous altitude \nand flew the remaining path. The Euler angles’ changes during these \nmaneuvers show that the main tool of maneuvering for multi-rotor is \nthrust vectoring by generating tilt (ϕ and θ) angles. It can also be visible \nin Euler angles graphs of Fig. 24 (a)-(c). \nThe multi-rotor has faces with two more possible faults and per­\nformed similar maneuvers. However, in the third one, we can see a new \nphenomenon which is trajectory replanning by decision making unit. \nSince before flying, RoboPV doesn’t know how many faults will be faced \nwith, in some situations, RoboPv encounters the low power charge to \naccomplish the mission. In such situations, decision making unit com­\nmand to replan the trajectory at higher altitude. Trajectory at higher \naltitude makes more coverage area at a scene and consequently results in \nshorter path, however with lower accuracy rather than previous one. \nThis shorter path guarantees accomplishing the mission by remaining \npower charge. Fig. 24 also shows the state variables during the three \nfault detection maneuvers at the third PV plant. It can be seen in altitude \ndiagram of Fig. 24(c), just after the third maneuver, the flight trajectory \nhas been re-planned and the multi-rotor climbed to the relative height of \n20 meters instead of 15. \n5. Conclusion \nIn this study, an autonomous aerial monitoring system, called \nRoboPV, was designed for intelligent and real-time monitoring of PV \nplants RoboPV has four integrated processing units including boundary \ndetection, path planning, dynamic processing and fault detection, that \nFig. 23.

Moradi Sizkouhi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nEnergy Conversion and Management 254 (2022) 115217\n18\ninteract with each other to execute an autonomous and accurate aerial \ninspection. One of the main features of RoboPV is its ability to \ncommunicate with Pixhawk flight autopilot via MAVLink API protocol. \nAccordingly, RoboPV can navigate and control a various set of multi- \nrotor’s configuration and does not have dependency to a specific type. \nMoreover, RoboPV provides a full coverage during the flight of aerial \nmonitoring by using an optimal path planning algorithm. For this pur­\npose, firstly, the boundary detection unit employed an accurate encoder- \ndecoder network to extract the boundary area of PV plants. Next, the \npath planning unit has created an optimal trajectory, by which the \nmulti-rotor was able to cover and to scrutinize all the regions of the PV \nplant. The main objective of this optimization process is coverage the \nentire PV plant in a minimum time so that the captured images have the \nnecessary overlap for ortho-mosaicking and the time required to fly \nbecomes within the flight endurance of the multi-rotor. During the aerial \ninspection by the multi-rotor, the fault detection unit analysed the \ncaptured aerial images with a trained deep model to localize the \npotential faults on PV modules at a pixel level. Eventually, these faults \nwill map to the earth fixed local level coordinated system. In this \nmapping, the precise locations of the faults are extracted and reported to \nthe serviceman for servicing and troubleshooting. Early diagnosis and \nrepairing prevents the faults becoming more serious and significantly \nreduces repair costs. \nIn order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed software \nsystem, three aerial monitoring mission have been simulated putting \nprocessor in the loop (PIL) for three given PV plants. These PV plants \nhave different shapes to evaluate the ability of the path planning algo­\nrithm to produce optimal paths for PV plants with complicated shapes. \nFrom these PIL tests, we conclude that RoboPV is satisfactorily \ncompatible with the multi-rotor dynamic. It has successfully performed \nthe monitoring mission for large-scale PV plants, even with irregular \nshapes. All RoboPV features were PIL simulated and its performance has \nbeen shown. For instance, dynamic processing unit commanded the \nmulti-rotor to maneuver and reduce the altitude for precise imaging \nFig. 24. Multi-rotor states during the third PV plant monitoring.  \nA.M.

The results prove that \nRoboPV can execute the autonomous aerial inspection with an overall \naccuracy of 93% for large-scale PV plants. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nA.M.

Introduction\nIn recent years, renewable energy sources have contributed signifi-\ncantly to the power generation due to degradation of the fossil fuels such\nas coal and oil, global warming, and ever rising energy demand. Solar\nenergy is the most promising source of energy generation among re-\nnewables whose demand is continuously rising due to merits like envi-\nronmentally friendly, zero operating costs, and simple technical\nrequirements. A significant advancement made in PV technology has\nhelped to decrease the material costs for solar cells, which increases the\nusage of PV technology rapidly all over the world. According to the\nreport of International Energy Agency (IEA), the total PV system ca-\npacity of the work will increase to 400 GW by 2023 (PVPS, 2023) and\nhence, the global capacity has been swiftly expanding over the past few\ndecades. A PV array consists of modules and complex cabling which is\nused to convert the photoelectric energy, and it often operates in harsh\nenvironmental conditions. Numerous faults or abnormalities such as\nshort circuit faults (Pillai et al., 2019a), open circuit faults (Akram and\nLotfifard, 2015), inverted bypass diode (Madeti and Singh, 2017a),\nbypass diode faults (Madeti and Singh, 2017b), hot spots (Bressan et al.,\n2018), aging degradation shading (Dhoke et al., 2018), micro crack\n(Dhimish et al., 2019), etc., can occur due to corrosion, high winds,\nsoiling, temperature cycling, heavy rain, hail, rodent gnawing, UV\nexposure, and perhaps incorrect shipping, installation, and mainte-\nnance, etc. On the DC side of the array, conventional protection devices\nsuch as an arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI), an over-current protection\ndevice (OCPD), and a ground fault detection and interrupter (GFDI) etc.\nare typically installed to prevent the catastrophic events from occurring\n(Alam et al., 2015). The detection of lower mismatch or higher imped-\nance faults early on is challenging, requiring more time and potentially\ncompromising the efficiency of PV systems, and in severe cases, leading\nto fire incidents (Mellit et al., 2018). Consequently, automatic fault\ndetection techniques are vital for detecting early faults in the plants to\noperate, maintain, and repair them in an efficient, reliable, and safe\n* Corresponding author at: Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India.\nE-mail addresses: bhaljafari@nu.edu.sa (B.

Hence, the research on development of effective and efficient\nfault detection techniques for PV system is increasing in the academic\nand industrial communities over past few years.\nThe mathematical modelling of the PV system plays a crucial role in\nthe accuracy of fault detection methods (Madeti and Singh, 2018). In\nthis paper, a method has been proposed that uses the irradiance, tem-\nperature, and optimized voltage data collected from the sensors of the\nPV system for detection and classification of faults. Additionally, a new\nPV system modelling has been introduced to validate the performance of\nthe method. The materials and fabrication methods used in PV modules\nvary as a result, each module has distinct characteristics that are tested\nunder various operating conditions such as standard testing condition\n(STC) and nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT). It has been\nsuggested in the past to model PV modules using manufacturers’ data\nsheets however, those methods exhibit some limitations that are dis-\ncussed hereby. Based on the proposed method in (Di Piazza et al.,\n2013a), the I~V and P~V curves are only reproducible under the STC\nconditions and the prediction of the PV system on varying temperatures\nand irradiance levels is not possible. According to (ALQahtani et al.,\n2012), the presented method characterizes the performance of the\nmodules under fixed standard test conditions only i.e., it can simulate\nthe response at 1000 W/m2 for various temperatures, but not at 25 ◦C for\ndifferent irradiance levels as these conditions are outside standard test\nconditions. According to (Ortiz-Rivera and Peng, 2005), the manufac-\nturer’s datasheet can be used to simulate the voltage-current-power\nrelationship for a given PV module. Nevertheless, it uses a parameter\ncalled Vmin, refers to the PV module open circuit voltage at 200 W/m2\n.\nThe manufacturer’s datasheet does not typically specify Vmin accurately\nand hence, the data can be used to calculate the appropriate value.\nDespite emulating modules accurately, (Chenni et al., 2007a) used a\nfixed series resistance and ideality factor, which limits its applicability\nand further model readjustments are necessary to adjust for the I-V\ncurve. Depending on the temperature, differences in series resistance\nand ideality factor occur and this limits the accuracy when an ideality\nfactor is fixed (Xiao et al., 2004a). By comparing the curve with\nexperimental data, the value of the series resistance (Rs) is also deter-\nmined, which cannot be achieved simply by using the data sheet of the\nPV module. Based on da Costa et al. (2010), the Rs is related to the\ntemperature and this method uses an iterative differential evolution\ntechnique to find the constant temperature coefficient which is\ncomputationally complex. According to Villalva et al. (2009), the model\nconsiders Rs as a fixed value for different temperatures and iterates for\nmaximum power point (MPP) values to determine the values of Rs.\nDespite many methods considering the ideality factor does not vary with\ntemperature regardless of PV cell technology (Villalva et al., 2009; Salmi\net al., 2012; Walker, 2001), temperature does affect it. The study con-\nducted in Villalva et al. (2009), determines a suitable fixed ideality\nfactor by arbitrarily selecting the value and then fitting the curve ac-\ncording to the ideality factor. Existing models primarily limit their\nrepresentation of PV modules to STC data points and in this proposed\napproach, we incorporate an additional data point derived from the\nNOCT, complementing the manufacturer’s provided data at STC. This\ninnovative modelling technique establishes a systematic framework for\ncorrelating the values of Rs and the ideality factor with the module\ntemperature. By integrating NOCT and STC data points, this model\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of characterizing PV output re-\nsponses under varying environmental inputs. Also, the proposed meth-\nodology has been implemented in MATLAB/Simulink simulations for\neffectively validating the proposed fault detection and classification\nmethod through its application to the simulated model.\nThe investigation of various faults can be computationally chal-\nlenging for detection when the PV system operates at lower irradiance\nlevel since disturbances introduced to different parameters may not be\nnoticeable. Various fault detection techniques for PV arrays have been\nproposed in the literature over last decade. Based on the sensing prin-\nciple,\nvarious\nfault\ndetection\ntechniques\nsuch\nas\ntime\ndomain\nreflectometry (TDR) (Roy et al., 2017), earth capacitance measurement\n(ECM) (Takashima et al., 2008), Electroluminescence (EL) imaging\n(Bedrich et al., 2018), thermal imaging (TI) (Gallardo-Saavedra et al.,\n2018) and electrical characteristics monitoring (Yi and Etemadi, 2017)\nhave been proposed. Using TDR method, the aging or ground faults can\nbe detected and located through the reflection of special signals into PV\nstrings and comparing them with the normal strings (Roy et al., 2017).\nIn (Takashima et al., 2009), an ECM method is used to find and identify\ndisconnected PV strings by measuring the earth capacitance and\ncomparing it to values from both normal and possibly faulty strings.\nEven though ECM and TDR methods can both predict the fault locations\nwithout being affected by solar irradiance, they have their own limita-\ntions such as ECM can only spot open circuits, whereas TDR can only\ndetect changes in impedance. By applying the modules with a\nforward-bias voltage, the EL method can capture light emitted by solar\ncells. The EL images of PV modules can be used to detect microcracks in\nthe internal solar cells, but an external power source along with a dark\nenvironment to observe the PV modules is required. The infrared cam-\neras are used to obtain the thermal images of the PV modules operating\nunder real-time scenario. Literature studies show that the electrical\ncharacteristics methods are the commonly used techniques (Pillai et al.,\n2019b) which is used for detection and classification of various faults in\nPV system. The electrical characteristics-based methods can further be\ndivided into threshold methods based on physical models or signal\nprocessing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques based on data and\nrules (Chen et al., 2018). Infrared thermographic (IRTG) is another fault\ndetection methodology for PV system where faults can be detected\nthrough imaging and analyzing temperature distribution patterns\nlocalizing the faulty part (Kandeal et al., 2021). An automatic fault\ndetection in PV system through electroluminescence (EL) images has\nbeen conducted by the comparison of YOLOv8 and an improved\nYOLOv5, enhanced with a Global Attention Module (GAM) and Adap-\ntive Feature Space Fusion (ASFF) (Mazen et al., 2023). The improved\nYOLOv5 achieved a mean average precision of 76.3 %, further increased\nto 77.7 % with test time argumentation (TTA), surpassing the perfor-\nmance of YOLOv8. Some other techniques include: ultraviolet (UV)\nfluorescence (K¨ontges et al., 2020), statistical approach (Harrou et al.,\n2018), etc.\nIn threshold-based fault detection methods, fault indicators are\nmanually extracted and analysed to determine the threshold and pro-\ncedure for determining faults. In Tadj et al. (2014), Silvestre et al.\n(2014), Saleh et al. (2017a), Gokmen et al. (2013), various fault sensi-\ntive indicators have been tested under faults using a physical model of\nthe PV system and the analysed indicators are then compared with the\npredetermined thresholds to develop fault detection procedures. The\nrecorded time-series data is additionally subjected to various signal\nprocessing methods which helps reduce the influence of measurement\nnoise on fault detection and allows for the utilization of the data’s\ntemporal characteristics (Dhimish et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2017; Kang\net al., 2012). The above-mentioned fault detection techniques based on\nthe threshold are proven to be effective however, fault detection and\nassessment of the threshold manually require a lot of time, and there is\nlimited reach for generalization. Further, fault detection performance is\nseverely affected by PV model accuracy, and different faults can only be\ndiagnosed to a limited extent.\nSeveral artificial intelligence-based fault detection methods have\nbeen proposed in recent years to overcome the issues associated with\ntraditional threshold-based methods used in arrays and build accurate\nfault diagnosis models automatically based on abundant data samples\nand expert knowledge (Youssef et al., 2017). Machine learning, fuzzy\ninference system (FIS), and artificial intelligence (AI) methods are\nmostly used for fault detection in PV arrays. There has been considerable\nexploration and application of conventional machine learning algo-\nrithms to fault detection of PV arrays. Black-box fault detection models\nare commonly built using machine learning based on abundant data\nsamples. These methods can be further subdivided into unsupervised,\nB. Aljafari et al.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 2156–2178\n2158\nsemi-supervised, and supervised. A supervised machine learning-based\nfault detection method relies on labelled sample data. The array fault\ndetection can be achieved by many supervised machine learning algo-\nrithms including K-nearest neighbours (kNN) (Madeti and Singh, 2018),\nartificial neural networks (ANN) (Chine et al., 2016), probabilistic\nneural networks (PNN) (Garoudja et al., 2017), random forest (RF)\n(Dhibi et al., 2020), support vector machine (SVM) (Jufri et al., 2019\nJun 1), decision tree (DT) (Benkercha and Moulahoum, 2018), etc. Also,\nthe fault detection method can be built using supervised machine\nlearning methods, but the cost of obtaining numerous labelled samples is\nhigh. In contrast, the semi-supervised machine learning methods require\nonly very little labelled data, and unsupervised methods merely use\nunlabelled data samples. Numerous machine learning algorithms have\nbeen proposed for fault detection in the array i.e., K-means clustering\n(Liu et al., 2019), graph-based semi-supervised learning (Zhao et al.,\n2014), and unsupervised clustering (Zhu et al., 2018) however, data\nsamples distribution strongly affects the accuracy of the algorithm.\nUnlike machine learning methods, FIS methods establish fault detection\nmodels quickly by using fuzzy rules derived from expert experience and\nlinguistic fuzzy. It can detect and classify based on interferences similar\nto those made by humans. To improve fault detection in PV arrays,\nhybrid artificial intelligence algorithms were used that combine the\nadvantages of machine learning and FIS algorithms (Gaviria et al.,\n2022). Fault detection methods can be automatically developed using\nmachine learning or FIS methods, but they still need to be based on\nrobust analyses of fault impact to manually extract fault features from\nthe raw data. Additionally, this may result in limited performance and\ncompromise the efficiency of the above model. Table 1 provides a\nsummary of various fault detection techniques for PV system stating\ntheir advantages and disadvantages.\nHence, to address the disadvantages of existing techniques, in this\npaper, a novel robust and highly efficient architecture for online\nmonitoring and fault detection in GCPV system has been proposed. The\nmajor contributions of this work are:\n➣A\nmathematical\nmodeling\nof\nthe\nPV\nsystem,\nincorporating\ntemperature-dependent parameters such as ideality factor, series\nresistance, and thermal voltage, is proposed, tested and validated\nagainst real-time data, ensuring accuracy and reliability in simula-\ntions under real-time operating scenarios.\n➣An Internet of Things (IoT) platform integrated with a one-\ndimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) deep learning\narchitecture is proposed for robust and accurate fault detection,\nenabling automated and efficient fault classification.

Description of Real-time Experimental Setup\nThis study focuses on a 15 kWp grid-connected solar PV system\ninstalled on the roof of a Mechanical Department building of the\nSRKREC, Bhimavaram, India, as shown in Fig. 1. The latitude and\nlongitude of the installation site i.e., Bhimavaram is 16.5449◦N and\n81.5212◦E respectively. The site receives an average solar irradiance\nand ambient temperature of 853.59 W/m2 and 32.57 ◦C during\nFebruary month. With a power rating of each PV module as 230 Wp, the\nsystem consists of 66 multi-crystalline silicon PV modules connected in\nseries-parallel. This study focuses on the LG Solar’s LG230M1C, poly-\ncrystalline PV module whose technical specifications are given in\nTable 2. The PV array consists of 6 strings connected in parallel with 11\nmodules connected in a string. To monitor the operation of PV plant, the\nNI PCI-6221 data logger has been used to record the electrical and\nmeteorological parameters. The solar irradiance has been measured via\na reference cell whereas K-type thermocouple is used to measures the\nambient temperature (Ta) of the site. Also, resistive voltage divider\ncircuits have been used that act as voltage sensors to measure voltage of\nthe array. Fig. 2 shows the solar irradiance, temperature, respective DC\npower and AC power outputs of PV system recorded from 17th February\n2023–20 th February 2023 in a ten-minute time scale i.e., six samples\nper hour and 144 samples per day.\n3. Modelling of the PV system, description of various faults and\nexisting sensor placement techniques\n3.1. PV system modelling\nIn this paper, a model has been developed based on the relationship\nbetween the ideality factor and series resistance (RS) as a function of\ntemperature. As shown in Fig. 3, this model uses a single diode model to\nstimulate the cell with a current source, a diode, along with parallel\n(RSh) and series resistances (RS).\nAccording to Kirchhoff’s current law, PV module voltage and current\nrelationship can be expressed as follows\nI = Iph −ID1 −IRsh\n(1)\nwhere Iph represents the light current, IRsh represents the current lost due\nto shunt resistances, and ID1 represents the voltage-dependent current\nlost to recombination current. Based on the Shockley equation, the diode\ncurrent can be expressed as follows\nID1 = Is\n⎧\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪\n⎩\ne\n(\nq(V+IRs)\nKTA\n)\n−1\n⎫\n⎪\n⎬\n⎪\n⎭\n(2)\nwhere, Is, K, q, Io, I, V, Rs, A, Rsh represent the diode reverse saturation\ncurrent, Boltzmann’s constant, elementary charge, reverse saturation\ncurrent, output current, voltage, series resistance, diode ideality factor\nand shunt resistance respectively and leakage current flows through Rsh\nis given by\nIRsh = V + IRs\nRsh\n(3)\nAdding Eqs.

Since the power generation occurs\nat high irradiance levels and in the neighborhood of the maximum\npower point (MPP), the simplification introduced by neglecting Rsh does\nnot significantly affect the validity of the model.

(2004), the proposed model exhibits\nless error between the measured and calculated values.\n3.2. Classification of Faults in PV arrays\nThe PV system may experience a variety of DC faults such as short-\ncircuit, open-circuit, inverted bypass-diode, and partial shading faults\nthat decrease the overall power generation, efficiency, and reliability.\nThe large-scale PV system can get severely damaged by short-circuit\nfault that occurs due to water getting into the conductors, animals\nchewing the insulation, and DC arcs damaging the junction box. In this\nwork, the short circuit in the system has been created by connecting two\nnodes of adjacent strings. Furthermore, their voltage difference will\ndetermine the value of the reverse fault current. It is difficult to detect\nthese short-circuit fault cases using traditional fault detection methods\ndue to a low voltage difference and low fault currents. As a result, the\nprotection device may not detect currents during this fault (Alam et al.,\n2015; Yi and Etemadi, 2017). This study emphasizes detecting\nshort-circuited fault cases under variable atmospheric conditions,\nespecially when the irradiance levels are low. As part of this study, two\nfault scenarios are used to implement the Line-to-Line fault, identified as\nLL-1 and LL-2. The first scenario involves two short-circuited modules\nand the second involves short-circuited modules in a pair of strings. The\nPV arrays are susceptible to these faults so, detection techniques need to\nbe introduced and discussed to prevent power losses or fires. According\nto Zhao et al. (2014), a short-circuited fault has zero resistance, which\ncorresponds with the fault settings for LL-1 and LL-2.\nThe PV system power output is affected significantly by shading\nfaults during the day, which are recently being modeled and studied. To\nserve the protection devices for the exact classification, it is essential to\ndifferentiate them from other fault types, even though their effects are\nnot permanent. In this paper, two shade cases are considered in which\nthe first five modules of one string are subjected to shading using gela-\ntine paper in the first case (SHADE-1), and five modules are shaded in\nbetween adjacent strings in the second case (SHADE-2). Also, it is\nassumed that the shaded modules are usually operated with a shunt\nbypass diode. In this case, the module surface only receives half of the\nsolar radiation and is at the same temperature as standard test condi-\ntions. However, different shading patterns and shading factors can be\nused to perform the shading fault. The inverted bypass diode faults result\nfrom bad connections made by the operator between bypass diodes\nacross PV modules.\nFinally, by disconnecting electric wiring between PV modules, open-\ncircuit faults are created in the system. A PV string with one, two, and\nthree open circuit faults is designated by OPEN-1, and OPEN-2\nTable 4\n%Error calculated between the proposed model and the model developed by\nSchmidt et al.

The MATLAB/Simu-\nlink model which is used to simulate different faults occurring at STC has\nbeen shown in Fig. 7. It can be observed from Fig. 8 that during short-\ncircuit fault conditions, Voc and Vm change their values (decreases)\nwhile Isc and Im remain the same. However, in the open-circuit fault\nconditions, Isc and Im values are significantly decreasing, while Voc and\nVm remain almost unchanged. In addition, shading faults greatly affect\nthe Im and Vm, while the Isc and Voc remain similar to their normal\ncondition values. Finally, during an inverted bypass diode fault condi-\ntion, the values of Isc, Voc, Im, and Vm vary as compared to the normal\nscenario.\n3.3. Comparison of various sensor placement techniques\nThe voltage measurement is the preliminary requirement of any fault\ndetection algorithm however, a large-scale PV system consists of\nnumerous modules that initially require a lot of voltage sensors. Various\nexisting sensor placement techniques and their disadvantages need to be\nanalysed to optimize the number of voltage sensors. Table 4 lists the\nsensor requirements for the existing fault detection methods (Gaviria\net al., 2022; Chatterjee et al., 2011; Chenni et al., 2007b; NIWE_-\nWRA_DATA/DataTable; Xiao et al., 2004b; Zdravkovic et al., 2009;\nJiang et al., 2013; Di Piazza et al., 2013b; Schmidt et al., 2004; Saleh\net al., 2017b; Hu et al., 2015; Pei et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2018) for an N×P\narray and an example of an 11×6 PV array. It can be observed from\nTable 5 and Fig. 9 that a higher number of voltage sensors, complex\nFig. 8.

Additionally, in the existing techniques, the\nvoltage sensors are subjected to unequal stresses, and if a sensor fails, the\nPV output power gets reduced as a result of it acting as a short circuit\n(similar to the Line-to-Line Fault).\n4. Proposed fault detection technique for PV arrays\nIn this section, a detailed explanation on the implementation of the\nproposed fault detection technique in the PV system has been given. A\nflowchart showcasing the steps involved in the implementation and\nanalysis of the proposed technique has been provided in Fig. 10.\n4.1. Proposed voltage sensors placement approach\nIn this paper, a new voltage sensor placement approach for PV arrays\nwith lower sensor counts to address the demerits of the above existing\ntechniques has been proposed. According to the proposed sensor\nplacement approach as depicted in Fig. 11, the Nth module voltage dif-\nference is monitored by this voltage sensor arrangement between the ith\nand (i+1)th strings. Accordingly, the proposed methodology requires\nonly ((N-1)/2)×P/2 voltage sensors, regardless of the number of mod-\nules connected in a string. Compared with the existing techniques\n(enumerated in Table 5), the proposed method significantly improves\nwhen the value of N is even. Furthermore, a sensor failure has a negli-\ngible effect on power output, because the voltage sensor is connected\nbetween two equipotent nodes as a result, the proposed method is su-\nperior in terms of cost and safety.\nIn this paper, a 15 kWp grid-connected PV system is used to illustrate\nthe proposed voltage sensor placement approach. The system consists of\nsix strings, and each string consists of 11 PV modules connected in series.\nThe differential voltage sensors (Vd1, Vd2, Vd(N-1)/2 read the maximum\nbecause all the modules are operating at the maximum power point.\nWhen the fault occurs, the voltage of the faulty string differs signifi-\ncantly from the healthy string. The faults have been created at different\nlocations of the 11×6 PV array in the MATLAB/Simulink platform for a\nbetter understanding of the proposed approach using I-V characteristics.\nFurthermore, the model formulations for arrays connected to grid-\nconnected inverters are derived using generalized expressions for Vd.\n4.2. Proposed deep learning-based IoT architecture\nSeveral manufacturers like General Electric, Asea Brown Boveri, and\nSIEMENS have developed systems to detect faults in the PV systems due\nto the great advancements in the field of online monitoring and fault\ndetection (Rahman and Xu, 2016; Ahmad et al., 2022; Bernd Stecher).\nTherefore, to take advantage of these systems in GCPV systems, a deep\nlearning-based IoT architecture has been developed in this paper. By\nanalysing the differential voltage sensor readings, the fault type can be\naccurately diagnosed. Online fault detection techniques are highly\ndesirable since they allow measurements to be taken while the device is\nin use. In the recent industrial sector, this could play a crucial role in\nincreasing electric network protection (Elsisi et al., 2021a, 2021b). This\nIoT platform comprises three parts: networking, a user interface and\napplications. The hardware system should able to transmit and receive\ndata to and from the cloud. Wi-Fi, a short-range IoT network, provides a\nhighly secure, fast, and data-intensive solution for small-scale, confined\nIoT systems. In the IoT platform, fault signals are collected and stored, as\nwell as fault types and locations of fault are automatically displayed on\nthe designed tool. Cloud-based IoT systems can process data at the\nnetwork edge using edge computing. Also, network protocols like MQTT\nand HTTP are used to collect data, and interfaces e.g., OPC and Modbus\n(IoT platform for digital business models, 2023). An IoT platform must\nhave a user interface and to communicate with IoT platforms, operators\nuse the contact element as shown in Fig. 12. The IoT platform stores and\nanalyses different voltage sensor measurements, as well as automatically\nidentifying faults in the solar PV system. Considering the data un-\ncertainties in account, the integration of 1D-CNN and IoT platform for\nmonitoring and fault detection in GCPV systems has not been yet\naddressed in the literature.\nHence, this study focuses on fault detection in PV array based on the\nIoT integration which is used here to collect and acquire data. The\npractical training datasets from the SRKREC, India have been used in\nthis study. A microcontroller can convert the differential voltage signal\nand time into an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter while supporting a\nvariety of communication interfaces such as OPC and Modbus and by\nusing HTTP and MQTT, it can be connected to the cloud.\nAdditionally, for fault detection in the GCPV system, a one-\ndimensional convolutions neural network (1D-CNN) deep learning\napproach belonging to the deep CNN method (Kiranyaz et al., 2015) that\ndeals with 1D data based on 1D signal has been proposed. The CNN\nmodel mainly comprises of two layers i.e., convolution layer and fully\nconnected layer (Kiranyaz et al., 2021) in which the new features are\nextracted by sliding one kernel over the input data in case of convolution\nlayer whereas the convolution layer flattens its output to decide the type\nof input class in case of fully connected layer. Fig. 13 illustrates a typical\n1D-CNN architecture, which has 4 layers: input, convolution, pooling,\nand flattening.\nA 1-D data set with c variables and n samples is received by the input\nlayer. There are neurons in the input layer equal to the number of tar-\ngets, which is a multilayer perceptron (Kwon et al., 2021). The mathe-\nmatical description of the 1D-convolution can be given as\nFig. 11. Proposed voltage sensor placement strategy for 11×6 PV array.\nB. Aljafari et al.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 2156–2178\n2167\nxk\nj = f\n( ∑\nN\ni=1\nxk−1\nj\n× Kk\nij + wk\nj\n)\n(25)\nA feature map is built with an input (x), a bias (w), and a convolution\nkernel (K), along with an activation function (f). Also, it is standardized\nto the same scale so that the input data will enhance the effective and\nstable structure of the neural network. To normalize the model, batch\nnormalization is used, which also helps to avoid overfitting. The down\nsampling of a convolutional layer that decrease the parameter length\nand increase calculation speed in 1D-CNN is determined by a pooling\nlayer. The dropout layer along with batch normalization and pooling can\nalso be used to address the issue of over-fitting. In the training phase, the\ndisabled neurons are randomly removed. The input for a fully connected\nlayer is created by flattening the convolutional layers output and\nFig. 12. Grid-connected PV plant monitoring using proposed IoT infrastructure.\nFig. 13.

Lastly, the output layer as-\nsigns probabilities to each label. In this case, a 1-D max pooling tech-\nnique has been applied to decrease the sampling of the convolutional\nresults from two convolutional layers, along with two pooling layers. It\nis carefully designed for the softmax, dropout, and full connection layer.\nThe 1D-CNN model output shape and parameters are summarized in\nTable 6.\n4.3. Operation under noise and low light conditions\nThe proposed technique has the potential to show robust perfor-\nmance under both noisy and low light conditions and ensures reliable\noperation during every scenario. The advanced data preprocessing\ntechniques such as smoothing filters and noise reduction algorithms has\nbeen applied to the real-time data collected by the IoT sensors to\nmaintain the integrity and minimize the noise impact. During the\ntraining phase of the model, 1D-CNN has been exposed to numerous\nnoisy data, enabling it to learn for identification and focusing on rele-\nvant features while disregarding random noise. The training process\nimproves the ability of the model to accurately detect various faults even\nin presence of noise. Additionally, the operation of the proposed system\nTable 6\nParameters of each layer of the proposed 1D-CNN.\nLayer(type)\nOutput Shape\nParameters\nConv1D_1(Conv1D)\n(None,\n6,\n132)\n760\nbatch_normalization_1(Batch1)\n(None,\n6,\n132)\n542\nmax_pooling1d_1\n(None,\n3,\n132)\n2\nConv1D_2(Conv2D)\n(None,\n3,\n66)\n42,526\nbatch_normalization_2(Batch2)\n(None,\n3,\n66)\n266\nmax_pooling1d_2\n(None,\n1,\n66)\n1\nFlatten\n(None,\n66)\n1\nDense_1\n(None,\n66)\n4280\nDropout_1\n(None,\n66)\n1\nDense_2\n(None,\n33)\n2140\nDropout_2\n(None,\n33)\n1\nDense_3\n(None,\n6)\n202\nTotal Parameters :\n50722\nFig. 14.

Additionally, the proposed technique\nhas been designed to perform effectively under the low light (low irra-\ndiance) conditions as temperature-dependent parameters are incorpo-\nrated into the mathematical modelling of the PV system that consist of\nideality factor, series resistance, and thermal voltage which are critical\nunder low irradiance scenario influencing the system behaviour. As\ndiscussed previously, the model is validated against real-time data to\nensure its reliability and accuracy to detect fault under any irradiance\ncondition. Also, the sensors are calibrated carefully to capture the data\naccurately under a wide range of irradiance levels ensuring consistent\nperformance under every scenario.\n5. Results and discussion\nIn this section, the accuracy of the proposed model has been theo-\nretically validated to evaluate its classification accuracy. The operation\nof the GCPV system can be easily determined by measuring the values of\nthe differential voltage sensors values. If the sensor values remain\napproximately equal to zero then the system is operating normally\notherwise, it is considered that there is a fault in the system. Also, it is\npossible to decode this condition using the if statement. While the DC\nside of the GCPV system has various faults such as open-circuit, short-\ncircuit, partial shading, and inverted bypass-diode, an efficient classifier\nis needed to detect these faults and classify them. A total of 448 datasets\nare collected, which can be divided into 7 types of faults whereas 64\nsamples for each fault are used for testing. As a result, to identify the\nabove-mentioned faults in the GCPV system, the deep 1D-CNN is pro-\nposed and to train and test the proposed 1D-CNN, a real-time meteo-\nrological and differential voltage sensors dataset from 15 kWp GCPV is\ncollected.

(26) which is used to evaluate the performance of the classification\nmodel.\naccuracy =\nTrue Positive + True Negative\nTrue Positive + False Positive + True Negative + False Negative\n(26)\nThe losses and accuracy of the 1D-CNN model have been graphically\nrepresented in Fig. 14 where it has been found that the model does not\nshows any overfitting after a training of 220 epochs. Also, it can be seen\nfrom Fig. 15, that the accuracy of the training and testing models have\nbeen found as 98.36 % and 96.32 % respectively. It has been illustrated\nthat both testing and training loss values eventually stabilize, with\ntesting loss value increasing more than training loss.\nThe confusion matrix has been depicted in Fig. 15 from which it can\nbe seen that the CNN model is capable of identifying faults in all classes\nwith 100 % accuracy, most notably in OPEN1 and SHADE1 fault con-\nditions. Also, it can be observed that the model is less accurate in\nidentifying the LL-2 fault with a value nearly equal to 96.87 %. Based on\nthese results, it can be concluded that the proposed CNN model performs\nwell without being overfitting. Additionally, different training values\ncan give different performance scores to the CNN algorithm. The final\nCNN model shows the classification accuracy is 98.15 %. An evaluation\nof the proposed 1D-CNN approach as compared to existing machine\nlearning methods has been represented in Fig. 16 in which it can be\nobserved that the 1D-CNN shown notable higher performance with\nclassification accuracy rate of 80.12 % followed by the random forest\n(RF) (78.15 %), extreme gradient boosting model (77.78 %) and deci-\nsion tree model (72.59 %).\nIn this study, the entire modelling has been done in the free and\nopen-source platform of Python. According to Table 7, the faults (open-\ncircuit, short-circuit, partial-shading, and inverted bypass diode) in the\nDC side of the GCPV plant have been classified using various parameters\nof the 1D-CNN, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient\nboosting models. Also, decision tree approach (or white-box approach)\ncan be used to visualize the fault diagnosis of the GCPV based on the\nFig. 18.

Aljafari et al.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 2156–2178\n2171\nvoltage values of differential sensors.\nThe classification of the PV system fault can be easily explained and\ninterpreted using the decision tree model by using the graph theory.\nBased on the featured differential voltage sensors data, Fig. 17 shows a\nregression tree that can be fitted to the fault detection technique in a\nGCPV plant with a 3-depth maximum.\nA tree with seven leaf nodes has the V1 feature as its root node. For\nexample, 612 samples of the open-circuit faults are correctly classified\nwhen V1>4.725 and V1=363.125. Furthermore, an additional valida-\ntion of the trained models using XGBoost, RF, Decision Tree, and the 1-\nDCNN for accuracy has been conducted by using another independent\ndataset as shown in Fig. 18. From the analysis (given in Table 8), it has\nbeen found that the Decision Tree, XGBoost, RF and other fault detection\nmethods have significantly less accuracy than the proposed approach\n(98.15 %).\nAs a result, the proposed deep CMM model learns patterns and ex-\ntracts features automatically from the datasets. Feature learning can be\nachieved without deep expertise in signal processing and knowledge of\nfeature design. The voltage sensors often have uncertainties of ±4 %\nand to demonstrate these uncertainties, this study adds a 4 % uncer-\ntainty to the collected datasets. In addition, cyberattacks are the most\nsignificant threat to IoT implementation where intelligent attackers with\ninternet access can intercept the transferred data and increase or\ndecrease the signals between the PV plant and IoT platforms easily.\nConsequently, non-economic conditions may distort the performance of\nthe GCPV plant. In cyberspace, numerous types of cyber-attacks include\nscaling attacks, ramp attacks, and random attacks. In scaling attacks, the\nreal measurement signals are altered by applying a scaling factor. In\ncontrast, ramp attacks involve interrupting the real measurement signals\nby injecting short pulses of varying intensities. The random attacks vary\nFig. 20. IoT platform for diagnosing and visualizing DC side faults in a\nGCPV plant.\nFig. 21. IoT dashborad showing status of GCPV plant during normal operation.\nB. Aljafari et al.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 2156–2178\n2172\nthe real measurement signals randomly which are the most harmful\nattacks among all. Hence, a suitable technique is required to recognize\nand overcome this type of attack (Habibi et al., 2021). So, a CNN al-\ngorithm has been proposed in this paper which can be an effective\nmethod for recognizing such attacks to combat this problem. Further-\nmore, the proposed CNN algorithm has been trained and validated using\na dataset created using a randomly distributed function. Several un-\ncertainties and cyberattacks have been included in the training and\ntesting datasets of the proposed CNN model and its corresponding model\naccuracy and loss has been represented in Fig. 19.\nFrom the graphs, the accuracy of the proposed 1D-CNN approach has\nbeen found as 93.12 % during training while the testing accuracy rea-\nches 88.11 % after same 288 epochs without any overfitting. During\ntesting, the losses values have been increased as compared to the\ntraining losses values to maintain the small differences between them. A\n7-fold cross-validation approach is used in addition to test the robustness\nof the proposed CNN model. In this dataset, an estimated classification\naccuracy of 90.03 % has been achieved by the 1D-CNN. Additionally, to\naccess the robustness and blind data classification of the 1D-CNN\napproach, a testing framework has been used. The independent tested\ndataset of training model has been used to classify the faults in the GCPV\nplant hence, the proposed approach is capable of distinguishing between\nthe fault classes accurately mainly in case of open-circuit fault and\ncyberattacks. However, the approach fails to identify the short-circuit\nand partial shading faults when the uncertainties and cyberattacks\nhave been taken into account. Additionally, to evaluate the performance\nof the proposed approach, various feature sizes have been applied in this\ninvestigation. Moreover, the proposed 1D-CNN approach has been found\nsuperior in performance even when the sample size gets limited to 448\nsamples as compared to the model proposed in (Zou et al., 2020). Due to\nits robustness and generality, the proposed approach avoids over-fitting\neven when a small sample size is used. Hence, the proposed IoT platform\nand 1D-CNN approach can accurately identified faults in the GCPV plant\nafter the completion of training and testing. The following experimental\ncase studies demonstrate an IoT platform to identify GCPV faults from\ndifferential voltage sensor readings and visualize them on the IoT based\ndashboard. The steps involved in the fault detection and data visuali-\nzation in the IoT dashboard has been represented through the flowchart\nrepresented in Fig. 20. The proposed IoT dashboard gives the details of\nthe GCPV plant such as location, latitude and longitude, date, time,\nirradiance, temperature, capacity, power, voltage, current along with\nstatus of the plant in detail.\n5.1. Operation under normal condition\nThe real-time PV system described in Section 2 has been monitored\nfor 21st February 2023 under normal operation and the measured data\nsuch as solar irradiance, temperature profiles, and differential voltage\nsensor values in the developed IoT dashboard have been shown in\nFig. 21. During normal operation, the differential voltage sensors read\nthe values approximately equals to the Varray/N. The proposed IoT\ndashborad can provide a clear visual representation of the normal\noperation of the GCPV plant. In addition, the dashboard provides a green\nindication that states the normal operation of GCPV plant.\n5.2. Operation under short-circuit fault condition\nTo validate the proposed IoT based 1D-CNN approach, the GCPV\nsystem has been operated under a short-circuit fault condition (LL-2) on\n22nd February, 2023 at 10:00 AM IST. Fig. 22 illustrates the irradiance\nFig. 22. IoT dashborad showing status of GCPV plant during short-circuit fault.\nB. Aljafari et al.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 2156–2178\n2173\nvalues, temperature, power, variation in differential voltage values, and\nthe status of the GCPV plant in the developed IoT dashboard. The power\noutput of the system deteriorates from 8.32 kW to 1.1 kW at 10:00 AM\nduring this fault condition and continues to generate lower power till the\npresence of the fault (can be noticed from the power graph). It can be\nobserved from the dashboard that the proposed approach effectively\ndetected and identified the short-circuit fault and displayed in the IoT\ndashboard. Additionally, the green light turns into red that indicates and\nwarns the plant operator stating abnormal operating condition of the\nsystem. Hence, in this way, the decisions can be made more effectively to\nmaintain good operating and faultless condition in GCPV plant for long\ntime.\n5.3. Operation under open-circuit fault condition\nThe GCPV plant suffers from low-energy discharge due to open-\ncircuited fault and hence, it is important to identify these defects to\nensure that the GCPV plant continues to work effectively. The open-\ncircuit fault (OPEN-1) has been created in the GCPV plant on 22nd\nFebruary at 03:22 PM and the recorded data along with the status of the\nplant have been displayed in the developed IoT dashboard shown in\nFig. 23. The power output from the system decreases from 6.23 kW to\n1.23 kW during this fault scenario. Also, it can be seen that the proposed\napproach can effectively detect the open-circuit fault and notify the\noperator about the abnormal condition of the GCPV plant by changing\nthe indication to red color.\n5.4. Operation under partial shading fault condition\nThe GCPV plants are highly vulnerable to partial shading that\nreduces the power output of the system and hence, it is imperative to\ndetect partial-shading faults early to ensure the health of the GCPV\nplant. So, to test the effectiveness of the proposed 1D-CNN approach in\ndetecting the partial shading fault, the GCPV plant has been operated\nunder partial shading (SHADE-1) on 23rd February 2013 at 02:03 PM.\nThe power output of the PV system has been found to get significantly\nreduced from 14 kW to 1.86 kW during partial shading resulting in\nlosses. Also, it can be viewed from the dashboard shown in Fig. 24 that\nthe proposed approach can effectively record the data during partial\nshading and notify the user with red indication on detection of partial\nshading in the system.\n5.5. Operation under inverter bypass diodes fault condition\nTo prevent the module of the GCPV plant from deteriorating,\ninverted bypass diode faults must be detected and repaired effectively.\nHence, to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in\ndetecting and visualizing the inverted bypass diode faults, the bypass\ndiodes of the modules have been inverted during operation on 23rd\nFebruary, 2023 at 04:45 PM. During this fault, the power output from\nthe system suddenly decreases from 7:86 kW to 1.82 kW resulting in\nsignificant power losses in the system. The dashboard of the system\nduring this scenario has been shown in Fig. 25 from which it can be\nobserved that there is a reduction in the power output of the system\nduring inverted bypass diode fault. Also, the proposed approach changes\nthe traffic light color to red to alert the operator about the condition of\nthe GCPV plant.\nFig. 23. IoT dashborad showing status of GCPV plant during normal operation open-circuit fault.\nB. Aljafari et al.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 2156–2178\n2174\n5.6. Security status of network against cyberattacks\nAs far as IoT systems are concerned, cyberattacks pose the biggest\nthreat to the system. As a result, this case is designed to validate the\nefficacy of the proposed approach in anticipating the cyberattacks for\nreliable and secure monitoring of the GCPV plant. A cyberattack sce-\nnario has been created in the GCPV plant by interpreting the data in the\nIoT platform. The resultant dashboard shown in Fig. 26 shows that the\nproposed approach can efficiently detect cyberattacks in the plant. As a\nfurther indication of the cyberattack to the operator, the proposed IoT\ndashboard provides a red indication about the abnormal condition.\n5.7. Performance metrics for fault detection\nThe proposed 1D-CNN based fault detection fault detection tech-\nnique has been evaluated using performance metrics that provide a\nquantitative assessment of the accuracy and reliability in detecting\nfaults in the PV system. The statistical metrics used for evaluation\ninclude:\nTrue Positive Rate (TPR): TPR (or sensitivity/recall) measures the\nproportion of actual positive faults cases correctly detected by the pro-\nposed model calculated using Eq. (27).\nTPR =\nTrue Positives(TP)\nTrue Positives(TP) + False Negatives(FN)\n(27)\nFalse Positive Rate (FPR): FPR is the measure of the proportion of\nactual negative cases (no faults) that are incorrectly identified as posi-\ntive by the proposed model, calculated using Eq. (28).\nFPR =\nFalse Positives(FP)\nFalse Positives(FP) + True Negatives(TN)\n(28)\nPrecision: Precision is the measure of the proportion of positive\nidentifications that are actually correct given by Eq. (29) as\nFPR =\nTrue Positives(TP)\nTrue Positives(TP) + False Positive(FP)\n(29)\nF1-Score: F1-score provides a balance between the precision and\nTPR and offers a single measure stating the accuracy of the proposed\nmodel given by\nF1 −Score = 2 × Precision × TPR\nPrecision + TPR)\n(30)\nThe above performance metrics can be calculated based on the\nconfusion matrix results (in Fig. 15) obtained from the predictions of the\nproposed model. Table 9 presents the detailed calculation of perfor-\nmance metrics for different fault cases using the proposed 1D-CNN\nmodel for fault detection. The results show the superiority of the pro-\nposed 1D-CNN based fault detection method, achieving high TPR and\nF1-score with lower FPR during all the fault cases. This validates the\neffectiveness and reliability of the proposed technique in accurately\ndetecting and classifying faults in GCPV systems.\n5.8. Assumptions and limitations\nThe above results prove the efficacy of the proposed technique in\ndetecting faults and cyberattacks in GCPV system with higher accuracy\nrates of 98.15 % and 93.12 % respectively and has the potential to\neffectively identify and classify faults, outperforming many existing\nsystems. However, the proposed investigation deal with several as-\nsumptions and limitations while design and operation in real-time\nscenario.\nFig. 24. IoT dashborad showing status of GCPV plant during normal operation partial shading fault.\nB. Aljafari et al.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 2156–2178\n2175\n5.8.1. Assumptions\nThe assumptions taken during designing of the proposed technique\nare as follows:\n➣Data Accuracy: The environmental and operational data from the\nsensors has been assumed to be consistent and accurate without any\nmajor errors.\n➣Model Stability: The 1D-CNN model can effectively generalize from\nsimulation training to real-time operation scenarios without any\nsignificant performance degradation.\n➣Sensor Reliability: All the sensors deployed in the GCPV system are\nconsistently reliable and operations, and provides uninterrupted and\nerror-free data for fault detection.\n➣Homogeneous PV Module Characteristics: The PV modules in the\nGCPV system shows uniform behaviour according to the manufac-\nturer specifications under STC.\n➣Environmental Conditions: The environmental condition was stable\nduring the testing and calibration of the proposed model.\n5.8.2. Limitations\nThe main limitations of the proposed technique may include:\n➣Cost and Complexity: Increase in initial setup cost and complexity of\nthe system due to implementation of deep learning model and IoT\ninfrastructure.\n➣Data Quality Dependence: The proposed model relies of the quality\nand consistency of the environmental and operating scenarios data\nthat has a higher potential of variation.\n➣Scalability: The proposed technique may require additional cali-\nbration and possibly more sophisticated models for increases vari-\nability in case of large and diverse PV systems.\nHence, the above analysis shows that the proposed 1D-CNN deep\nlearning-based fault detection algorithm can effectively detect and\nclassify various types of faults along with cyberattacks in the PV system.\nAlso, the developed IoT dashboard displays the details and status of the\nPV system with additional feature of providing indication and alarm\nduring fault in the PV system.\n6. Conclusion\nIn this paper, an IoT integrated 1D-CNN approach for online moni-\ntoring and fault detection in grid-connected PV (GCPV) system has been\nproposed. Additionally, an optimal sensors placement approach has\nbeen proposed for the GCPV plant that effectively measures the voltages\nof the system to track the operation condition and furthermore reduces\nthe sensors count, cost and complexity of the system. Also, the modelling\nof the PV system has been done by considering the temperature\ndependent parameters in simulation, compared with real-time data and\nfound exhibit very less error during normal operating scenario at STC\nand NOCT. The modelled system has been tested under numerous fault\ncases such as short-circuit, open-circuit, partial shading and inverted\nbypass diodes faults in the simulation and the data are used in the\ntraining and testing of the proposed 1D-CNN approach. The accuracy of\nthe 1D-CNN approach has been tested and found to be higher i.e.,\n98.15 % (during fault) and 93.12 % (during cyberattack) as compared to\nother machine learning techniques such as Random Forest (81.52 %),\nDecision Tree (71.59 %), XGBoost (78.77 %), ANN (83.56 %), IEC\nFig. 25. IoT dashborad showing status of GCPV plant during normal operation during inverted bypass diode fault.\nB. Aljafari et al.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 2156–2178\n2176\nRefined (62.05 %), SVM (78.89 %), Duval (59.12 %), and Rogers\nRefined (61.25 %). The 1D-CNN approach can also be able to classify the\nfaults based on the differential voltage sensor values connected in the\nGCPV system. The proposed 1D-CNN approach also considers the data\nuncertainty during training and testing to prevent the fault classes from\noverlapping due to limited data availability and inaccurate measure-\nment methods. Later on, an IoT based dashboard has been designed to\nvisualize the system and location details, operating condition such as\nirradiance and temperature, generation data and status of the GCPV\nsystem. The approach has been experimentally validated using a 15 kWp\nreal-time GCPV plant under short-circuit, open-circuit, partial shading\nand inverted bypass diodes faults along with a cyberattack scenario. The\nconducted analysis shows that the proposed approach can effectively\ndisplay the operating condition of the plant, detects the faults and notify\nthe operator about the with indication during abnormal system opera-\ntion in a faster way. Hence, in the proposed approach, the decisions\nabout the status of the GCPV plant can be made more accurately, un-\ncertainties and over-lifting can be avoided with a superior performance\nwithin a small sample size. Hence, the proposed approach provides a\npromising solution that can be used in PV power plants for reliable and\nefficient operation. The solutions for potential limitations such as\nenhancing data preprocessing, expanding model validation across\ndiverse conditions, integrating advanced sensor technologies, and\ndeveloping adaptive learning frameworks to improve the robustness and\nscalability of the proposed PV system fault detection technique can be\nthe future scope of this research.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nBelqasem Aljafari: Writing – original draft, Formal analysis, Data\ncuration, Conceptualization.

Introduction\nThe reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation has become a significant con-\ntributor to greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) [1], leading to detrimental effects on the\nenvironment, such as climate change and air pollution. In stark contrast, the adoption of\nrenewable energy sources, especially solar power, offers a pathway to effectively mitigate\nthese impacts. According to recent reports, the global renewable energy capacity saw\na remarkable increase of 257 GW in 2021, reaching a total of 3064 GW. Among energy\nsources, solar energy emerged as the frontrunner, with an increase of 133 GW, marking a\n19% growth and pushing the global solar capacity to 849 GW [2].\nChina played a pivotal role in this growth, enhancing its solar capacity from 253 GW to\n307 GW, making it the largest contributor globally. The United States also made significant\nstrides, boosting its solar output by 94 GW [3], which represents a 27% increase. This\nexpansion has shifted the Asia–Pacific region into a leading position, now accounting\nfor over 60% of the world’s photovoltaic (PV) installations, totaling at least 947 GW. This\ntrend of increasing solar energy adoption reflects the growing recognition of its potential to\nprovide sustainable energy solutions, as depicted in Figure 1.\nSolar energy not only reduces GHG emissions but also promotes energy security and\neconomic growth through job creation in the renewable energy sector. Additionally, with\ntechnological advancements in solar panel efficiency and energy storage solutions, the\nfuture looks promising for solar power to play a central role in global energy strategies.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407. https://doi.org/10.3390/s24227407\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n2 of 20\nFigure 1. Evolution of installed solar capacity from 2004 to 2023 [4].\nPhotovoltaic (PV) cells, depicted in Figure 2, are a solar technology that converts solar\nenergy into electricity with a nominal efficiency ranging from 15% to 20% [5]. This efficiency,\nhowever, affects the global adoption rate of solar energy [6], as the maximum performance\nof PV systems depends on several environmental factors, as shown in Figure 3. These\ninclude the accumulation of dust on the PV surface, operating temperature, hail, snow, wind\nspeed, shading, air density, and sky conditions. Among these factors, soiling losses due to\ndust, dirt, and other particles are particularly detrimental to PV module performance.\nDust refers to any particle less than 10 mm in diameter and originating from various\nsources such as sand, dirt, construction debris, rocks, volcanic ash, bird droppings, and\neroded limestone [7]. While dust accumulation can lead to reduced energy generation,\nit can also exacerbate soiling effects on panels [8]. Factors such as ambient temperature,\ntilt angle, soil conditions, and nearby vegetation significantly influence dust deposition,\nalong with the cover material of the PV module and the angle of sunlight [9]. Dust can be\ndeposited in three distinct ways: occult (mist, clouds, high humidity), wet (rainfall), and\ndry (wind). The composition of dust varies based on local environmental conditions, with\nhigher deposition rates occurring near industrial areas, in volcanic regions, and in areas\nprone to sandstorms [10].\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2. PV cell (a), electrical schematic diagram (b).\n1.1. Different PV System Faults\nPV systems experience a wide range of problems from being located outdoors, which\ncan significantly lower the PV energy output, reduce the potential, and most importantly\nmake it impossible to meet different load demands. Three basic categories can be used to\nclassify faults: physical, environmental, and electrical, as summarized in Figure 3.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n3 of 20\nFigure 3. PV system fault classification.\nElectrical faults include short circuits, circuit breaks, bypass diode faults, and shunt\nresistance insertion faults. These reduce the voltage and current, decreasing the power\noutput. Environmental faults include shading, which usually causes the bypass effect,\nwhere the corresponding currents are shifted and lower rated than the performance could\nbe at that point. Physical faults include micro-cracks and internal damages.\nPV modules’ performance and efficiency vary based on the dust accumulation level\nin their surrounding environment [11]. For example, dust particles significantly reduce\nirradiation levels, scattering the wavelengths of the incoming radiation. When a thick layer\nof dust coats a module’s surface, it alters its optical properties, increasing light reflection\nand decreasing transmissivity, which ultimately leads to a decrease in electrical output.\nAdditionally, dust accumulation can increase temperatures, causing a slight reduction in\nopen-circuit voltage (by 2–6%) and short-circuit current (by 15–20%). Research has shown\nthat a dust level of 4.25 mg/cm² can reduce the output power by 33%, while dusty modules\nproduced 8.41% less power compared to clean ones.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can assist in prioritizing maintenance tasks and optimizing\nthe scheduling of inspections and repairs by recognizing patterns and trends. The proposed\nAI-based detection system addresses this challenge by using deep learning models to\nautomatically identify and classify faults from image data. This approach offers an efficient,\ncost-effective, and scalable solution for real-time monitoring, ultimately enhancing the\nperformance and reliability of solar energy systems and supporting the growth of renewable\nenergy infrastructure.\n1.2. Contributions and Limitations\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n+\nExploring advancements and integrations of AI in solar panel systems.\n+\nAddressing challenges in detecting and classifying anomalies, which is crucial for\noptimizing performance.\n+\nIdentifying and classifying the factors contributing to anomalies in PV power, which\nis essential for evaluating their impact on model accuracy.\n+\nImplementing a model tested with PyQt5, enhancing user decision-making by provid-\ning an intuitive interface that simplifies interaction with the solar energy system.\nWhile the proposed AI-based detection system significantly contributes to enhancing\nsolar panel system performance, there are some limitations associated with the objectives\nof this research:\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n4 of 20\n-\nThe reliance on image-based data introduces challenges related to environmental\nfactors, such as lighting.\n-\nThe model’s ability to classify rare or unseen anomalies is limited by the diversity of\nfault data used in training, potentially reducing the accuracy in real-world applica-\ntions.\nDespite these limitations, the model provides a solid foundation for further advance-\nments in AI-driven anomaly detection in solar systems.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The related works are discussed\nin Section 2. The methodology is presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the obtained\nresults. The conclusions based on the outcome of the analysis phase are presented in\nSection 5.\n2. Related Works\nThe advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered dust detection systems has\nbeen the focus of researchers [12]. Various methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (kNN)\nand random forest, have been utilized to classify and detect dusty panels, along with the\napplication of deep learning models for this purpose [13].\nAnalytical measurement of solar panel performance can be performed using a LDR\nand multi-meter [14]. Using a single hidden layer containing nine neurons, an artificial\nneural network was established to predict the output voltage of solar panels based on input\nmetrics like irradiance and dust content. Additionally, a deep residual neural network and\nimage processing were employed to forecast uneven dust accumulation [15].\nThe CNN LeNet model with customized dropouts and pooling layers was used to\nachieve a mean squared error of 0.0122 and an 80% accuracy. Deep CNN architectures were\nalso used to develop a model from a dataset of 599 photos, achieving a 93.3% accuracy with\nthe AlexNet model. The authors studied PV deterioration and irregularity patterns using\nvarious machine learning and deep learning methods, considering the computation time,\ncharacterization techniques, datasets, and feature extraction processes [6,16,17].\n2.1. Review of Computer Vision Applications\nTo broaden the scope of this research, Table 1 provides an overview of notable com-\nputer vision applications in various fields. This highlights the diversity and impact of CV\ntechnologies, positioning the proposed study within a broader context of CV advancements.\nTable 1.

Prior Research in PV Fault Detection\nPrevious studies have primarily focused on testing models for classifying fault detec-\ntion in photovoltaic systems. In one study, a deep belief network was created to identify\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n5 of 20\ndust on PV panels, and the suggested model outperformed previous machine-learning-\nbased models in terms of accuracy [23]. A combination of the physical lotus effect approach\nwith the Mobile-Net and VGG-16 CNN methodologies for the evaluation of solar panels\nwas considered in [24]. Similarly, the performance of other machine learning algorithms,\nsuch as Facebook-prophet, isolation forest, and auto-encoder long short-term memory\n(AE-LSTM), was assessed for PV performance research. The outcomes provided straightfor-\nward insights to help with decision-making [25]. The impacts of dust and temperature on\nPV power generation were assessed using a deep-learning-based modular neural network\nin a subsequent study, which involved six PV modules in Sohar, Oman [26]. This paper\nsignificantly improves the CNN accuracy and performance by implementing the model\nwithin the PyQt5 framework. This advancement enables the classification of six distinct\nfault types, employing more advanced CNN architectures. Additionally, the integration\nof the model into a user-friendly PyQt5 interface enhances its accessibility and usability,\nmaking it a practical tool for real-world applications. Table 2 provides a comprehensive\nsummary of prior research in solar panel fault detection.\nTable 2.

It\nhad a rate of 89.75%.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. CNN Model\nThe primary goal of this project is to automate the detection of anomalies in solar\npanels using a deep learning approach [34]. The system classifies images of solar panels\ninto different categories based on whether they are faulty or functioning correctly. The\nsystem learns to detect and classify visual patterns from labeled solar panel images using\na convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically fine-tuned from the VGG16 architec-\nture [35]. The CNN model works by processing large datasets of solar panel images to\nidentify unique features and patterns associated with anomalies, such as cracks, dirt, or\nphysical damage. The trained model can accurately predict the type of anomaly or confirm\nthat the panel is functioning normally when provided with new, unseen images [36].\n3.2. Ensemble Learning Classifier\nEnsemble learning improves machine learning results by integrating multiple mod-\nels [37]. This approach involves training a group of classifiers or an ensemble, and then\ncombining their predictions for classifying unseen examples through a voting mechanism.\nBy leveraging this strategy, the prediction performance can surpass that of any single\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n6 of 20\nmodel. The fundamental idea is to train a diverse group of classifiers and allow them\nto contribute their insights. An ensemble model is developed by merging base models,\naddressing classification or regression challenges that individual models may struggle\nto solve effectively [38]. Consequently, ensemble learning can yield superior outcomes\ncompared to using a standalone model [39].\n3.3. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): LIME Approach\nMachine learning models have often been viewed as opaque “black boxes”, but explain-\nable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have emerged to clarify their functioning [40].\nThese methods aim to enhance users’ trust in machine learning models by providing in-\nsights into how they operate. Two widely used XAI approaches for tabular data are Shapley\nadditive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).\nLIME, in particular, offers local explanations that are independent of the underlying model,\nallowing for greater interpretability across different machine learning frameworks [41]. It\nillustrates how each feature influences the results for a particular instance. The classifi-\ncation models also indicate the probability of the instance belonging to a specified class.\nMoreover, it utilizes visual plots to highlight the importance of each feature within each\nclass, enhancing the interpretability and understanding of the model’s decisions [42].\n3.4. Solar Panel Dataset Description\nA dataset was designed to evaluate the performance of various ensemble machine\nlearning classifiers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in detecting physical and\nelectrical alterations to solar panel surfaces, such as dust, snow, bird droppings, and other\nchanges. It comprises six distinct classes for classification. While the dataset is reasonably\ncomprehensive, some imbalance exists in the number of images collected, due to their\nsourcing from online platforms. Table 3 provides details about the dataset, and Figure 4\nillustrates examples of the six different classes present within it.\nCapturing images at a moderate distance with minimal glare can help reduce noise\nand enable more precise pixel analysis. Optimal lighting conditions are also beneficial,\nas they can enhance a model’s ability to identify subtle fault indicators such as dust\naccumulation, physical damage, or electrical anomalies. These guidelines are intended to\nimprove the robustness of fault detection across various environmental conditions and\nwere incorporated to facilitate effective image capture for our model.\n3.5. The Proposed Detection of Solar Panel Anomalies\nThe proposed architecture consists of three key phases: preprocessing, feature ex-\ntraction, and data augmentation, which generates new data points from existing ones to\neffectively increase the dataset size, followed by the classification phase. Figure 5 illustrates\nthe model integrated with the ensemble classifier. Each component of the proposed model\nis elaborated upon in the following sections.\n3.5.1. Data Pre-Processing Phase\nThe dataset underwent oversampling to achieve a balance across all categories, re-\nsulting in each folder containing 205 images. The images were sourced from a directory\nhousing solar panel images and were resized to 100 × 100 pixels for uniformity. To simplify\nthe computation, RGB images were converted to grayscale. The dataset was then split into\ntraining and testing sets, allocating 80% for training and 20% for testing.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n7 of 20\nFigure 4. Classes of solar panels.\nTable 3. Description of solar panel dataset.\nClass\nBird-Drop\nClean\nDusty\nElectrical\nDamage\nPhysical\nDamage\nSnow\nCovered\nNum of\nImages\n206\n194\n191\n104\n70\n124\nFigure 5. Proposed solar panel anomaly detection and classification model.\n3.5.2. Feature Extraction Phase\nThe input image is encoded into a compact knowledge representation by the autoen-\ncoder, which employs a bottleneck architecture to facilitate this compression [43]. The\nnetwork employs an unsupervised learning algorithm for representation learning. The\nautoencoder’s core principle is to utilize its hidden layer to encode incoming sensor data,\neffectively creating an optimal feature representation before generating an output. This\nprocess allows the model to capture essential patterns in the data, while reducing the\ndimensionality. To create an output x that is a reconstruction of the original input x, an\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n8 of 20\nautoencoder reformulates the unlabeled dataset into a supervised learning problem. It\nutilizes a bottleneck structure that constrains the flow of information through the network,\nleading to a learned compression of the input image. This approach minimizes redundancy\nby focusing on the variations present in the input data. An autoencoder consists of two\nmain components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder transforms the input into a\nlatent space representation using its activation function, capturing the essential features,\nwhile reducing dimensionality. This process enables effective learning and reconstruction\nof the original data.\n3.5.3. Data Augmentation Phase\nTo further enhance the robustness of the model, the data augmentation phase played\na crucial role by creating additional training samples from the original dataset [44]. In this\nphase, a variety of image transformations, such as rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming,\nand horizontal flipping, were applied to introduce diversity to the training data. These\naugmentations simulated different real-world scenarios, such as varying orientations and\nscales of solar panels, changes in camera angles, or environmental conditions like shadows\nor slight misalignments. This phase not only helped the model generalize better to unseen\ndata, making it more effective in real-world conditions, but also significantly reduced the\nrisk of overfitting, where the model might otherwise have only learned to perform well\non the training data and failed on new data. By artificially expanding the dataset with\ntransformations, the model encountered a wider variety of possible input scenarios, making\nit more adaptable to different environmental conditions such as lighting variations, dust\naccumulation, or weather effects like snow and cloud cover.\n3.5.4. Model Fine-Tuning\nThe system utilized the pre-trained VGG16 model [45], a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork originally designed for large-scale image classification tasks [46], and fine-tuned\nit specifically for the solar panel dataset [47].The VGG16 architecture was selected for its\nsimplicity, effectiveness, and suitability for the specific requirements of solar panel anomaly\ndetection. While newer models such as ResNet and EfficientNet have demonstrated\nsuperior performance in various tasks, VGG16 was chosen due to its straightforward\narchitecture when fine-tuning a pre-trained model for fault detection in photovoltaic\nsystems. VGG16 has proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks, making it a\nreliable model for detecting anomalies in solar panels based on image data. Furthermore,\nVGG16 performs well with transfer learning, which allowed us to leverage pre-trained\nweights on large datasets, thus enhancing the model’s ability to generalize to smaller,\ndomain-specific datasets, like those used in this study. The use of transfer learning with\nVGG16 provided an efficient means of improving model performance without requiring\nextensive computational resources or large amounts of labeled data.\nThe decision to use VGG16 was grounded in its proven track record, simplicity, and\nadaptability to the specific goals of this research, ensuring a reliable and efficient solution\nfor the task of solar panel anomaly detection.\nDuring this process, the earlier layers of the network responsible for detecting low-\nlevel features such as edges, textures, and shapes were kept frozen, as they are generally\nsufficient to be effective across different domains. However, the last few layers, which\ncapture high-level features and make final predictions, were unfrozen and retrained on\nthe solar panel dataset. By retraining these high-level layers, the model adapts to domain-\nspecific features such as physical defects, environmental conditions, or anomalies like\ndust, cracks, or shading, which are critical for accurate fault detection in solar panels. This\nfine-tuning significantly improved the model’s ability to identify these specialized features,\nincreasing its accuracy and robustness in detecting anomalies. This approach is especially\nbeneficial because it combines the power of transfer learning with domain adaptation,\nenabling the system to efficiently learn from a relatively small dataset, while leveraging the\ngeneral knowledge acquired from large-scale pre-training on broader image data.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n9 of 20\n3.5.5. Classification Phase\nThe model utilizes CNN layers to classify predictor variables. CNNs have proven\neffective in various energy-related applications due to their ability to predict outcomes,\nirrespective of the underlying probability distributions of the different labels. Their paral-\nlel architecture and learning capabilities enhance their efficiency in pattern classification,\nallowing them to effectively categorize observations into distinct classes. While these\nnetworks may have a lower fault tolerance, their research has shown that they can approxi-\nmate any arbitrary function by adjusting the number of hidden layers and their associated\nparameters. The structure of the proposed deep neural network is detailed in Table 4 and\nillustrated in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Methodology for the proposed architecture.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n10 of 20\nTable 4.

Real-Time Predictions\nOnce the model has been trained, it can be used to classify new images of solar\npanels in real time. This provides fast and accurate anomaly predictions, enabling quick\nresponses to detected issues. By utilizing deep learning, this system can assist engineers\nand technicians in rapidly identifying faulty solar panels, enabling timely repairs and\nmaintenance. The deep learning-based approach improves the operational efficiency by\nreducing the need for manual inspections, potentially lowering maintenance costs and\nminimizing downtime for solar energy systems.\n3.6. Technologies for Model Implementation\n3.6.1. Tensorflow and Keras\nThe entire model was built using TensorFlow and Keras [48], two of the most widely\nadopted libraries for machine learning and deep learning.\n•\nTensorFlow: This framework handles the complex mathematical operations of deep\nlearning (e.g., gradient descent, backpropagation) and allows a model to execute\nefficiently on both GPUs and CPUs. TensorFlow also simplifies the training and\ndeployment of neural networks, making it easy to integrate with various platforms.\n•\nKeras: Keras acts as a high-level API over TensorFlow, providing an intuitive interface\nfor defining layers, building models, and conducting experiments. In this project,\nKeras was used to define the architecture of the VGG16 model, as well as the custom\nlayers added during fine-tuning.\n3.6.2. Vgg16 Pre-Trained Model\nVGG16 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is widely used for image clas-\nsification tasks [49]. It was first introduced in 2014 by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG)\nat the University of Oxford. This deep network comprises 16 layers and has achieved\nstate-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, including ImageNet, which con-\ntains over 14 million images spanning 1000 categories. VGG16 has proven to be highly\neffective due to its structure, shown in Figure 7, and its ability to generalize across various\nimage classification problems. VGG16’s availability in deep learning frameworks such as\nKeras and TensorFlow further simplifies its use, offering easy implementation for machine\nlearning tasks, especially when using pre-trained models through transfer learning.\nFigure 7. Architecture of VGG16.\n3.6.3. Transfer Learning\nTransfer learning [50] is a technique where a model trained on one task is reused for\nanother, related task, as depicted in Figure 8. This is particularly useful when limited data\nare available for the second task. In this paper, transfer learning was applied to leverage\nthe power of VGG16, which was pre-trained on ImageNet, to detect anomalies in solar\npanels. The process of transfer learning with VGG16 started by loading the pre-trained\nmodel from the Keras library. The weights of the initial layers were frozen, allowing the\nmodel to retain the general features it had learned from ImageNet (such as edges, textures,\nand shapes). The final layers were then trained on our specific solar panel dataset, allowing\nthe model to fine-tune itself for the task of detecting faults or anomalies in solar panels.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n12 of 20\nFigure 8. Architecture of transfer learning.\n3.6.4. Fine-Tuning\nFine-tuning [35] the last few layers of VGG16 allowed the model to adapt its high-level\nfeature recognition to the specific characteristics of solar panel anomalies. By unfreezing\nthese layers, the model could learn features relevant to this task, such as cracks or dirt\nthat impact solar panel efficiency. In this project, we specifically used transfer learning\nand fine-tuning on VGG16 to build an efficient model for detecting solar panel anomalies.\nThe combination of VGG16’s robust pre-trained features and our specific dataset led to\nimproved accuracy and reduced the need for extensive data collection. Overall, VGG16\ncombined with transfer learning provides a powerful framework for image classification\ntasks, offering both high accuracy and ease of use, particularly when datasets are small\nor noisy. It is an effective tool for the rapid deployment of machine learning models in\nreal-world applications such as solar panel fault detection.\nThe dataset, code, and developed application utilized for this research are publicly\naccessible, to enhance reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility for future studies in\nthe domain of photovoltaic system fault detection. The dataset comprises labeled images of\nsolar panels under various conditions, including classes for clean, dusty, physically damaged,\nelectrically damaged, bird-dropping-covered, and snow-covered panels. This comprehensive\ndataset enables robust training and evaluation of the machine learning models employed.\nThe code repository, available on GitHub, includes the following components:\n•\nData Preprocessing Scripts: These scripts prepare the dataset by resizing, normalizing,\nand augmenting images to increase the robustness and prevent model overfitting. Key\ntechniques include rotation, flipping, and zooming, to simulate real-world environ-\nmental conditions.\n•\nModel Training and Evaluation: The repository contains the code for training the\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) model, specifically leveraging a fine-tuned\nVGG16 architecture to classify anomalies in solar panels. The model is designed to\nidentify faults with high accuracy, utilizing both transfer learning and fine-tuning to\nadapt to the specific characteristics of the solar panel dataset.\n•\nPyQt5 Application Interface: A user-friendly interface developed with PyQt5 allows\nusers to seamlessly interact with the model. This application simplifies the process\nof uploading images, viewing predictions, and understanding results, making it\naccessible to non-technical users as well.\n•\nExplainability Features: The repository also includes code for implementing local\ninterpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), an explainable AI technique. This\nfeature helps users understand the factors influencing the model’s predictions, foster-\ning trust and interpretability in AI-driven fault detection.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n13 of 20\nThe link to the GitHub repository is provided in the Data Availability Statement\nsection of this paper, ensuring that researchers and practitioners can replicate, validate, and\nbuild upon the methodologies developed in this study.\n4. Results and Discussion\nThe following sections discuss in detail the data collection of environmental faults in\nsolar panels and provide a comparative analysis of the trained and tested fault images. A\nPC with 16 GB RAM and a core i7 8th generation processor with Nvidia GPU was used,\nand the experimental configuration was created using Google Colabs and TensorFlow 2.4.0.\nA total of 889 real images of solar panels under various fault circumstances were taken.\nThe images were subsequently separated into 80 and 20 percent groups for the training\nand testing of several neural networks using images of solar panels.\n4.1. Performance Evaluation\nConfusion matrixes are a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of machine\nlearning models, enabling the assessment of metrics such as the AUC–ROC curve, recall,\nprecision, and accuracy. They systematically assign predictions to the original classes of\nthe data, helping to identify the classification accuracy for each record and highlighting\npotential areas of concern. In the matrix, the rows represent the actual labels from the\ntraining dataset, while the columns reflect the predicted outcomes of the model. This\nvisualization aids in diagnosing the model’s effectiveness in accurately categorizing data.\nA confusion matrix is a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of algorithms\nthat classify outputs into binary categories, such as positive or negative (yes or no). It\ncomprises four cells, each representing a unique combination of expected and actual\noutcomes. These cells help identify true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives\n(FP), and false negatives (FN), allowing for a comprehensive analysis of a model’s accuracy\nand effectiveness in classification tasks. The following four outcomes are possible:\n•\nTrue Positive (TP): This means that a prediction was correct. This is occasionally\ndescribed as sensitivity.\n•\nTrue Negative (TN): This denotes a negative prediction that materialized. This quality\nis known as specificity.\n•\nFalse Positive (FP): Although the value was predicted to be positive, it turned out to\nbe negative. Type-I errors are frequently used to describe this.\n•\nFalse Negative (FN): The actual number was positive despite the negative forecast. A\nType-II mistake is another name for this.\nThe expressions for all the statistical parameters are given as follows:\nPrecision =\nTP\nTP + FP\n(1)\nRecall =\nTP\nTP + FN\n(2)\nTNR =\nTN\nTN + FP\n(3)\nF1-Score = 2 × Pr × Re\nPr + Re\n(4)\n4.2. Model Hyperparameter Setting\nThe parameters utilized during the training of the CNN are detailed in Table 5. The\ntraining process was executed with a 20% hold-out for validation, employing a mini-batch\nsize of 16 and 100 epochs. The trained CNN was then tested, and the accuracy was\ncomputed to validate the algorithm’s effectiveness. In the training, the Adam optimization\nalgorithm with a learning rate of 3e −4, Mini-Batch Size 16, L2 regularization with a factor\nof 0.0001, and piecewise learning rate schedule was used, with a drop factor of 0.9 every\n3 epochs. The execution environment was the CPU.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n14 of 20\nTable 5. Parameter values for CNN during training.\nParameter\nValue\nSolar Panel\nOptimizer:\nAdam\nLearning Rate:\n0.0001\nLoss Function:\nCross entropy\nMetrics:\nAccuracy\nBatch Size:\n15\nEpochs:\n100\n4.3. Model Evaluation\nIn the feature extraction process using an encoder/decoder approach, the first layer\nconsisted of an autoencoder with 2500 hidden nodes trained on the training dataset. The\nsecond layer employed another autoencoder, this time with 3400 hidden nodes, which were\ntrained on the features obtained from the first layer. Subsequently, a SoftMax layer was\ntrained on the features extracted from the second autoencoder. To enhance the efficiency, a\ndimensionality reduction procedure was applied to eliminate features that contributed the\nleast to the predictive variable. Retaining these irrelevant features could have negatively\nimpacted the model’s overall performance.\nA thorough analysis of the confusion matrix presented in Figure 9 reveals that some\nkey misclassifications occurred between categories such as physical damage, cleaning,\nand dust. These misclassifications may have arisen due to the similarities in the visual\nfeatures of these categories, particularly when certain types of faults like physical damage\nappeared visually similar to dust accumulation or dirt on the surface of the solar panel. To\nbetter understand these misclassifications, we analyzed the correlation matrix heatmap\nof the dataset, which visually illustrates the relationships between features. The heatmap\nhighlights which features were most strongly correlated with each other. High correlations\nbetween features can introduce redundancy, which may affect the stability of the model\nand its ability to distinguish between similar categories. The proposed model achieved\nan accuracy of 91.46%, reflecting its overall effectiveness, but also indicating areas for\nimprovement in distinguishing between visually similar faults.\nFigure 9. Correlation matrix of the solar panel dataset for the proposed model.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n15 of 20\n4.4. Xai (LIME) Feature Importance\nLIME evaluates the local fidelity of a model, which ensures that it effectively captured\ncharacteristics relevant to the predictions made. While local fidelity aims to describe a\nprediction’s context, it may not always align perfectly with the global behavior of a model.\nLIME analyzes the immediate surroundings of a prediction to assess its local accuracy and\nprovide an explanation. For instance, if a prediction is accurate but not aligned with the\nglobal model, LIME seeks high probability features in that vicinity to clarify the model’s\ndecision-making process.\n4.5. Pyqt5 Implementation\nThe results obtained from the PyQt5 interface demonstrate the high accuracy of the\ndeveloped model in detecting anomalies in photovoltaic (PV) panels, as shown in Figure 10.\nBuilt with PyQt5, the user interface provides a practical and user-friendly platform for\nreal-time interaction with the fault detection system. It allows users to upload images\nof PV panels and receive immediate diagnostic feedback, displaying predictions directly\non-screen, along with visual indicators of the identified faults.\nFigure 10. Results with PyQt5 implementation.\nThe high accuracy achieved by the model, as illustrated in this figure, demonstrates\nthe effectiveness of combining CNN architecture with fine-tuning on a solar panel-specific\ndataset. The fine-tuning of the VGG16 CNN model enabled it to learn the unique features\nassociated with common PV panel faults, such as dust accumulation, physical damage, and\nelectrical anomalies, which are critical for maintaining an optimal solar energy output.\nThis interactive application facilitates the timely identification and diagnosis of faults,\nreducing the need for manual inspection and contributing to improved operational effi-\nciency and reduced downtime in solar energy systems.\nGenerating a report from the application involves three steps, as shown in Figure 11.\nFirst, the user is prompted to upload an image of a solar panel that they wish to analyze\nfor potential anomalies, using the Upload Button . This can be achieved by selecting an\nimage file from the device or by simply dragging and dropping it into the designated area\nof the application interface. Once the image has been uploaded, a Preview Screen displays\nthe image, allowing the user to confirm or remove it if needed. At this stage, the user\ncan proceed by selecting the Start Processing button, which initiates the anomaly detection\nanalysis of the uploaded image.\nAfter processing, the application moves to the Prediction Results Screen, where\nthe detected anomaly type, such as “Dusty”, is displayed along with a confidence level\n(e.g., 94.9%). Additionally, a detailed chart visualizes the model’s confidence levels across\nvarious potential anomalies, such as ”Bird-drop”, “Dusty”, and “Physical-Damage”. Users\ncan download this chart for documentation purposes by selecting the Download Chart\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n16 of 20\nbutton. Finally, to begin a new analysis, users can reset the application using the Start Over\nbutton, which clears previous data and returns the interface to the initial upload screen.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 11.

Conclusions and Future Works\nDeveloping technologies to control solar panel energy generation has proven essential\nfor higher reliability and lower costs. As a renewable energy source, solar panels provide\npower without releasing any pollution. However, dirt, a significant environmental element\nimpacting energy generation, negatively affects the performance of solar panels. When dirt\nbuilds up on the surface of a solar panel, the amount of light that strikes it is diminished,\nthereby reducing the panel’s ability to produce electrical energy. This paper successfully\nimplemented a deep-learning model to classify solar panel anomalies by fine-tuning the\nVGG16 architecture. By leveraging pre-trained models, extensive data augmentation, and\npowerful optimization techniques such as the Adam optimizer, the model can accurately\npredict anomalies in solar panels based on image data. The model performed well through\nthe effective application of transfer learning and data augmentation, achieving better\nvalidation performance and reducing overfitting.\nThe reported test accuracy underscores the potential of this implementation in real-\nworld scenarios. The proposed model achieved a 91.46% accuracy, specificity of 98.29%, and\nF1 score of 91.67%. The model could properly classify various fault sources, demonstrating\nits effectiveness in practical applications.\nWhile the model showed robust performance in anomaly detection, it is important\nto note some limitations. The model’s performance heavily depends on the quality and\ndiversity of the training data. In cases where images are of low resolution or under\nsuboptimal lighting conditions, the detection accuracy could be affected. Despite these\nlimitations, the model’s robustness, particularly in the classification of dirt-related issues,\npositions it as a valuable tool for real-time monitoring of solar fields. In practice, it can\nhelp optimize maintenance schedules, reduce energy losses due to panel inefficiency, and\nextend the lifespan of solar installations.\nSensors 2024, 24, 7407\n17 of 20\nIn light of this study’s findings, several potential areas for future research and practical\napplication have been identified. Future research should focus on evaluating the long-term\neffects of dust accumulation on photovoltaic performance, exploring how variations in\ndust type, density, and particle size influence energy output. Furthermore, we envision\nintegrating video input, such as drone-captured footage, into the system to enable real-time\nstatus detection of solar fields. This addition would enhance the monitoring capabilities of\nthe application, providing dynamic, in situ assessments of panel conditions and further\nexpanding the practical applications of this study.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.L. and R.S.; methodology, Y.L.; software, Y.L. and A.E.M.;\nvalidation, R.S.; formal analysis, A.E.M. and R.S.; investigation, Y.L.; resources, R.S.; data curation,\nM.E.A. and Y.L.; writing, original draft preparation, Y.L.; writing, review and editing, R.S. and A.E.M.;\nvisualization, Y.L.; supervision, M.E.A.; project administration, M.E.A. and R.S.; funding acquisition,\nY.L.

Switzerland, like many other countries,\nhas set ambitious carbon neutrality goals, aiming for net\nzero emissions by 2050 through the widespread adoption\nof renewable energy technologies. Among these, solar\npower has emerged as a key contributor due to its cost\ncompetitiveness, market penetration, and signiﬁcant en-\nergy potential. However, to ensure the long-term viabil-\nity and eﬃciency of PV systems, improving their reliability\nand durability is crucial.\nOne of the major challenges in PV technology is the\nearly detection and classiﬁcation of defects and failures\nin solar modules. These defects can signiﬁcantly impact\nperformance, leading to increased degradation rates and\nhigher maintenance costs. ???Current defect detection\nmethodologies rely on visual inspections and electrolumi-\nnescence (EL) imaging, which often require multiple shots\nwith diﬀerent cameras, leading to inconsistencies and in-\neﬃciencies. A more robust and automated approach is\nneeded to enhance defect identiﬁcation, quantify perfor-\nmance losses, and ultimately extend the lifespan of PV\nmodules.\nThis project aims to address these challenges through\na two-fold approach. First, we develop an AI-powered,\nimage-based methodology for the quantitative and timely\ndetection of defects in PV modules. ??? Using an ultrahigh-\nresolution multispectral camera with UV to IR sensitivity,\nappropriate ﬁlters, and a specialized lighting setup, this\nresearch seeks to improve defect identiﬁcation at the cell\nlevel. Secondly, we present a novel approach to predict-\ning the maximum power point (Pmpp) of solar panels by\nintegrating image-based features and ???tabular data us-\ning a deep learning framework. The proposed method\nleverages a combination of convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) for image processing and fully connected layers\nfor tabular data, enabling accurate predictions of solar\npanel performance. The proposed methodologies lever-\nage neural networks to automatically classify failure modes\nand correlate them with module performance losses. The\neﬀectiveness of the approach will be validated using nat-\nurally aged PV modules from the TISO plant and other\nmodern modules with ﬁeld-induced defects. Figure 3.\nTo enhance the model’s ability to handle heteroge-\nneous imaging modalities (e.g., EL, UV, VIS), we explore\nrecent advancements in computer vision. While Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) have shown exceptional results in RGB\nimage classiﬁcation, applying them to multichannel imag-\ning is challenging due to the disparate nature of the inputs.\nTo overcome this, we employ the Channel Vision Trans-\nformer (ChannelViT) architecture, which eﬀectively pro-\ncesses independent channels and remains robust to miss-\ning modalities. This architecture is well-suited for cross-\ndomain generalization and is key to building a scalable,\nﬁeld-deployable classiﬁcation system. The results of this\nproject will have signiﬁcant implications for the photo-\nvoltaic industry, enabling a more eﬃcient and accurate de-\nfect tracking methodology. The adoption of AI-driven de-\nfect detection techniques can beneﬁt research laborato-\nries, manufacturing facilities, and operational PV systems\nby providing a quantitative, scalable, and reproducible method\nfor evaluating module performance. This approach will\ncontribute to improving the reliability of photovoltaic en-\nergy, reducing waste and supporting the transition to a\nmore sustainable future.\nThe outcomes of this work oﬀer signiﬁcant contri-\nbutions to the PV industry by enabling faster, more ac-\ncurate defect identiﬁcation and performance prediction.\nThis supports more reliable photovoltaic operation, reduced\nelectronic waste, and a more sustainable energy infras-\ntructure.\n2\n|\nINSTRUMENTATION AND IMAG-\nING METHODOLOGY\n2.1\n|\nProcurement of Instrumentation, Setup,\nand Calibration\nThe ﬁrst step in this work package is the analysis and\nprocurement of the necessary instrumentation for multi-\nspectral image acquisition. The selection of an industrial-\ngrade medium format camera with the highest native res-\nolution ensures optimal data acquisition and detail preser-\nvation. To prevent optical bottlenecks, an appropriate lens\n3\nFIGUR E 1\nDefected TISO cell as seen in EL, UV and VIS.\nis chosen to cover the entire module surface without the\nneed for image merging.\nA PhaseOne/Linos camera, previously tested in pre-\nliminary experiments, serves as a viable starting point when\npaired with a suitable lens. The instrumentation set-up\nwill be designed to maximize repeatability and accurate\ncolor reproduction through the use of calibration points.\nThe planned instrumentation includes:\n•\nPhaseOne iXM MV150f 150 Mpixel multispectral cam-\nera (to be procured);\n•\nHigh-resolution wide lens with UV, IR, and visible light\ntransmittance (to be procured);\n•\nMotorized ﬁlter wheel for switching ﬁlters (to be pro-\ncured);\n•\nTwo LED lamps for visible light, mounted at a 45-degree\nangle to prevent glass reﬂections (to be procured);\n•\nTwo UV LED lamps for photoluminescence, mounted\nat a 45-degree angle to avoid glass reﬂections (to be\nprocured);\n•\nPower supply to trigger electroluminescence in the\nmodules (to be procured);\n•\nColor reference target for accurate color space deter-\nmination (available).\nThe setup utilized in the feasibility study, as illustrated\nin Figure 2, provides a solid foundation for the calibration\nand acquisition processes. The calibration phase is criti-\ncal to ensure uniform color range capture across diﬀerent\nmodules.\nFIG U R E 2\nInstruments setup used for preliminary\ndata acquisition.\n2.2\n|\nLogistics, Preparation, and Image Ac-\nquisition\nA diverse set of photovoltaic modules exhibiting defects\nfrom long-term outdoor exposure will be analyzed. These\nmodules incorporate diﬀerent cell technologies to provide\na comprehensive dataset. Among the sets available:\n•\nModules with IBC cells from a walkable solar catama-\nran (2010-2015);\n•\nThe TISO PV plant dataset, containing 240 modules\nnaturally aged over 35 years;\n•\nAdditional sets from ongoing reliability projects at SUPSI\nand other PV installers.\n4\nModules will be cleaned, labeled, and barcoded for ef-\nﬁcient traceability. Each module will undergo high-resolution\nimaging, capturing ﬁve distinct images: red, green, and\nblue (visible spectrum), IR electroluminescence, and UV\nphotoluminescence. These multispectral images will be\ncrucial for training AI algorithms to identify cell failures.\nDefect detection will be signiﬁcantly enhanced through\nmultispectral imaging, which allows diﬀerentiation based\non wavelength response. For example:\n•\nUV light aids in detecting delamination;\n•\nVisible light highlights browning eﬀects;\n•\nIR imaging reveals hotspot formation.\nSome defects, such as hotspots, exhibit unique pat-\nterns across multiple wavelengths, making multispectral\nimaging a more powerful diagnostic tool than conventional\nelectroluminescence analysis.\n3\n|\nDATA\n3.1\n|\nData description\nWe use for training data\n•\nTraining DURAMAT data ’good’: 5877, ’crack’: 3242,\n’cross’: 3662, ’dark’: 2179\n•\nTraining our own labeled data: ’good’: 109, ’crack’: 83,\n’cross’: 26, ’dark’: 88, ’crackcross’: 24\n•\nAnd for prediction we use Inﬁnity: ’good’: 2112, ’crack’:\n39, ’cross’: 156, ’dark’: 21, ’crackcross’: 15, ’crack-\ndark’: 11, ’corrosion’: 306, ’corrosioncross’: 58, ’cor-\nrosioncrackcross’: 4, ’corrosioncrack’: 3\n4\n|\nELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS OF\nMODULE PERFORMANCE\nTo correlate imaging results with functional degradation,\nelectrical measurements will be conducted using a ﬂasher\nsimulator. Key parameters include:\n•\nMaximum power output (Pmax);\n•\nShort-circuit current (Isc);\n•\nFill factor (FF).\nA ﬂasher simulator will be used for these measure-\nments. As the performance data for TISO modules are al-\nready available, this analysis will primarily focus on newer\ntechnologies.\nThe key deliverables for this work package include:\n•\nCalibrated data acquisition system;\n•\nRaw dataset of multispectral images.\n5\n|\nDEFECT CLASSIFICATION\n5.1\n|\nImage segmentation\nSegmentation of panel images into single cells is a criti-\ncal task in automated quality control. Traditional manual\nsegmentation methods are time-consuming and prone to\nerrors, especially when dealing with large datasets. To ad-\ndress these challenges, we use an automated segmenta-\ntion pipeline that combines advanced deep learning mod-\nels with eﬃcient data processing techniques.\nOur segmentation process is driven by the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM), a cutting-edge deep learning frame-\nwork developed for generalized image segmentation tasks.\nIn this module, we implemented two key functions to fa-\ncilitate robust and automated segmentation of photovoltaic\n(PV) panel images:\n•\nsegmentSAMImage_automatic function is used to iden-\ntify the centroids of individual cells within the panel.\nOne limitation of SAM’s automatic detection mode\nis its tendency to produce overlapping masks by seg-\nmenting the same object multiple times. To mitigate\nthis, the automatic mode is employed primarily for\nestimating the panel layout rather than for direct seg-\nmentation. By analyzing peak patterns between de-\ntected centroid coordinates using SciPy’s ﬁnd_peaks\nfunction, we accurately infer the number of rows and\ncolumns of cells. This method eliminates the need\nfor manual input and provides a reliable, data-driven\nmechanism for grid estimation.\n5\n•\nsegmentSAMImage_predict function utilizes SAM’s pre-\ndictor in a guided fashion, applying predeﬁned grid\ncoordinates derived from the automatic segmentation\nphase. This approach improves precision by constrain-\ning the segmentation process within the expected cell\nboundaries, resulting in cleaner and more consistent\nmask generation.\nBoth functions incorporate OpenCV for preprocessing and\nimage manipulation tasks, and employ SciPy’s signal pro-\ncessing tools for grid structure estimation. This combi-\nnation ensures accurate and repeatable segmentation of\ncomplex panel layouts (see Figure 3).\nFollowing segmentation, the identiﬁed regions are post-\nprocessed to enhance the quality and usability of the re-\nsults. This includes the alignment of segmented images\nand the adjustment of the bounding boxes to account for\nthe variability in panel size, perspective distortion, and\nslight misalignment. These reﬁnements ensure that the\nextracted cell regions are properly standardized for sub-\nsequent analysis or model training.\nFIGUR E 3\nAutomatic TISO cell detection and\nsegmentation presented in Electroluminescence\nThe segmentation pipeline was evaluated on various\nPV panel image data sets and demonstrated high accu-\nracy in isolating individual cells. The integration of SAM’s\nautomatic mask generation signiﬁcantly reduced the need\nfor manual intervention, particularly in grid estimation.\n5.2\n|\nModel\nAnalyzing photovoltaic (PV) panels through multiple imag-\ning modalities—such as visual, electroluminescence (EL),\nand ultraviolet (UV)—demands models that can handle het-\nerogeneous spectral inputs eﬀectively. Traditional CNNs\nand ViTs trained on RGB images fall short in this context\ndue to their inability to explicitly account for modality-\nspeciﬁc characteristics and interactions.\nThis problem is solved by recent advancements in com-\nputer vision for multi-channel image analysis have demon-\nstrated signiﬁcant potential for photovoltaic (PV) panel\ndefect classiﬁcation, particularly when handling sparse or\nmissing imaging modalities. The Channel Vision Trans-\nformer (ChannelViT) architecture emerges as a particu-\nlarly suitable foundation for this task due to its inherent\ncapacity to process independent channel information while\nmaintaining robustness to missing channel [1].\nChannelViT extends the standard Vision Transformer\n(ViT) framework to support multi-channel inputs by treat-\ning each imaging modality as a separate input stream. This\nis achieved through a specialized embedding scheme that\ncreates distinct patch tokens for each channel, while main-\ntaining shared spatial positional information. This design\nensures both independent and joint representation learn-\ning across spectral modalities. Key architectural adapta-\ntions include:\n•\nModality-Speciﬁc Feature Encoding: Each channel (e.g.,\nvisual, EL, UV) undergoes an independent linear pro-\njection to produce initial patch embeddings. These\nprojections are \"tied\" across the spatial domain but\nare speciﬁc to each modality, enabling the network to\nextract features that are most relevant to each imag-\ning type.\n•\nCross-Channel Attention Mechanisms: The transformer\nlayers are conﬁgured to allow interaction between\npatches from diﬀerent modalities. This enables the\nmodel to learn relationships and correlations between\ndefects that may manifest diﬀerently across imaging\nspectra.\n•\nLearnable Channel Embeddings: To preserve and ex-\nploit modality-speciﬁc information, learnable embed-\n6\ndings are assigned to each channel. These channel\nembeddings are added to each patch token to guide\nthe model in distinguishing between spectral inputs\nduring attention computation.\nThe patch embedding for a given channel c and spa-\ntial position p is formulated as:\nzc,p = PosEmb(p) + ChnEmb(c) + W xc,p\n(1)\nwhere PosEmb(p) is the positional embedding, ChnEmb(c)\nis the learnable channel embedding, W is the projection\nmatrix, and xc,p is the input patch from channel c.\nThis formulation allows the network to maintain spa-\ntial coherence while distinguishing between spectral modal-\nities, eﬀectively modeling both intra- and inter-channel\ninformation.\nIn real-world PV diagnostics, certain imaging chan-\nnels may be unavailable at deployment time due to hard-\nware limitations or operational constraints. To train a model\nthat remains robust under such conditions, we introduce\nHierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS)—a training strategy\nthat exposes the model to variable subsets of channels in\na structured manner.\nUnlike traditional dropout, which may randomly omit\nchannels without constraint, HCS systematically samples\nall possible channel subset sizes during training. This en-\ncourages the model to learn ﬂexible representations that\ngeneralize across any combination of available modalities.\nThe sampling process consists of two uniform selections:\n•\nA random integer m is drawn uniformly from the range\n[1, C] the total number of channels.\n•\nA subset Cm of size m is selected uniformly at random\nfrom the full set of channels.\nThis approach ensures equitable exposure to all subset\ncombinations over time, reducing reliance on any single\nmodality and improving the model’s resilience to missing\ndata. By embedding this mechanism into the training loop,\nChannelViT learns to adaptively process whatever sub-\nset of modalities is available, making it highly suitable for\npractical PV inspection scenarios.\nMulti-Label Learning via Custom Loss Function\nPV cells often exhibit multiple defect types simulta-\nneously (e.g., microcracks, inactive regions, discoloration),\nmaking multi-label classiﬁcation essential. To accommo-\ndate this, we modify the ChannelViT output head to use\nsigmoid activations instead of softmax and replace the\ncross-entropy loss with a binary classiﬁcation loss func-\ntion.\nThe ﬁnal loss used is:\nLmulti-label = BCEWithLogitsLoss(ypred, ytrue)\nThis enables the model to independently assess the\npresence of each defect type, allowing for multiple con-\ncurrent class activations per sample. This setup aligns\nmore closely with the real-world PV panel defect anno-\ntations, where defect categories frequently overlap.\n5.3\n|\nPreprocessing Pipeline\nThe preprocessing pipeline was designed to handle multi-\nchannel image data from photovoltaic (PV) panels, includ-\ning Electroluminescence (EL), Ultraviolet (UV), and Visible\n(VIS) imaging modalities. For each PV panel in each chan-\nnel (EL, UV, VIS) the mean and standard deviation of pixel\nvalues were calculated. Image data were normalized to\nzero mean and unit variance per channel (EL, UV, VIS) and\nper PV panel, to ensure that the pixel values of the images\nare scaled consistently across all channels and that each\ncell represents relative diﬀerence of the brightness across\nthe whole PV panel. This step is crucial for stabilizing the\ntraining process and improving model convergence.\nTo construct the multi-channel input, the grayscale\nEL, UV, and VIS images were stacked along the channel\naxis, producing a single 3-channel input where each chan-\nnel represents one modality. This uniﬁed format allows\nthe model to jointly process multi-spectral information\nduring training and inference. Image labels were converted\nto one-hot encoded vectors to support multi-label classi-\nﬁcation of co-occurring defects.\nTo further improve the robustness of the model, we\nhave used the data augmentation technique by generat-\ning additional training samples from the original dataset.\n7\nThis process involved applying a range of image transfor-\nmations—including rotation, shifting, and horizontal ﬂip-\nping—to increase the diversity of the training data. These\naugmentations eﬀectively simulated real-world variations\nsuch as diﬀerent panel orientations, camera angles, and\nenvironmental factors like misalignments. As a result, the\nmodel was better equipped to generalize to unseen data,\nreducing the risk of overﬁtting and enhancing its real-world\nperformance. By artiﬁcially expanding the dataset, the\nmodel was exposed to a broader spectrum of input con-\nditions.\n5.4\n|\nChallenges with unbalanced data\nWe have observed that model is struggling with the un-\nbalanced data and has learned a spurious correlation or\nshortcut, associating the number of input channels with\nthe speciﬁc class labels. The phenomenon we are observ-\ning suggests the model has created a very simple, and in-\ncorrect, decision boundary:\n•\nIf the input has 1 channel, the model predicts one of\nclasses 0-3.\n•\nIf the input has 7 channels, the model predicts one of\nclasses 4-7.\nThis behavior is a common challenge in machine learn-\ning when datasets have confounding variables. The chan-\nnel count has become a proxy for the defect class, and\nthe model is exploiting this easy-to-learn heuristic instead\nof extracting the complex visual features of the defects\nthemselves. This explains why the classes unique to the\n7-channel data perform well—the model is essentially just\ndetecting the presence of 7 channels and making a cor-\nrect guess based on that simple cue. Conversely, it ex-\nplains the poor performance on classes from the 1-channel\ndata, as the model is not learning to generalize their fea-\ntures when they appear in a 7-channel context.\nWe have tried three strategies to mitigate this spuri-\nous correlations. To break this harmful pattern and force\nthe model to learn the true defect features, we must de-\ncouple the relationship between channel count and class\nlabel during training.\n•\nAugment the 7-Channel Data with Channel Masking\n- The goal is to force the model to see examples of\nclasses 4-7 with a single channel, breaking the exclu-\nsive link. You can use data augmentation to randomly\nmask out 6 of the 7 channels in the 7-channel data,\neﬀectively creating synthetic 1-channel versions of\nthe defect classes that were previously only seen in 7-\nchannel data. During the training phase, for a given 7-\nchannel image, randomly select a subset of channels\nto keep (e.g., 1 to 4 channels) and zero out the rest.\nThis will create a more diverse training set where the\nclass labels are no longer tied to a speciﬁc channel\ncount.\n•\nBalance the Dataset by Class and Channel Count -\nThe 90/10 split is a signiﬁcant imbalance that encour-\nages the model to learn the shortcut. You must cre-\nate a more balanced representation of all classes and\nchannel counts in your training data. Resample our\ndataset to have a more even distribution of both classes\nand channel counts. This involve oversampling the 7-\nchannel data to match the volume of the 1-channel\ndata.\n•\nFine-tuning with a Two-Stage Approach - Training on\nthe combined, imbalanced dataset from the start may\nbe too diﬃcult. A staged approach can help the model\nbuild a robust foundation before being exposed to\nthe more complex data. Stage 1: Fine-tune our model\nexclusively on the 1-channel data. This will force it to\nlearn the features of classes 0-3 from their primary\ndata source. Stage 2: Then, ﬁne-tune the model on\nthe full 7-channel dataset, ensuring you use the afore-\nmentioned data augmentation and balancing techniques.\nThis allows the model to adapt to the higher chan-\nnel count while retaining the features it learned in\nthe ﬁrst stage. However, this ﬁne-tuning must be\ncarefully managed to prevent catastrophic forgetting.\nInstead of simple data augmentation, focus on cre-\nating a balanced training batch. Oversample the 7-\nchannel data to give classes 4-7 a stronger voice in\nthe training process without being completely over-\nwhelmed by the volume of 1-channel data. A batch\nwith a roughly equal number of samples from each\nclass would be ideal. Selective Layer Freezing - freez-\n8\ning the lower layers of the ChannelViT model during\nthe ﬁne-tuning stage. These early layers are respon-\nsible for learning low-level, generic features (edges,\ntextures, etc.) that should be similar across both chan-\nnel modalities. By freezing them, you preserve the\nfoundation learned from the 1-channel data, allow-\ning the model’s higher-level layers to specialize in the\nunique features of the 7-channel data without over-\nwriting its core knowledge.\n5.5\n|\nExperimental Validation Protocol\nThe evaluation process in this study was designed to\nrigorously assess the performance and generalization\nability of the deep learning models trained for photo-\nvoltaic (PV) panel defect classiﬁcation. To rigorously\nassess the generalization capability of the trained model,\nthe Inﬁnity dataset was completely excluded from the\ntraining and validation phases. This dataset served\nas an independent test set, ensuring that no informa-\ntion from Inﬁnity inﬂuenced model optimization or\nhyperparameter selection. After model training, pre-\ndictions were generated for the Inﬁnity data, and per-\nformance was evaluated using several metrics, with\nparticular emphasis on the confusion matrix. The con-\nfusion matrix provided a detailed breakdown of the\nmodel’s classiﬁcation accuracy across all classes, high-\nlighting both strengths and areas for improvement\nwhen applied to previously unseen data. This approach\nallowed for an unbiased evaluation of the model’s real-\nworld applicability and robustness.\n5.6\n|\nCross-Domain Evaluation Method-\nology\nModel\nDURAMAT Acc\nINFINITY Acc\nZero-Shot Acc\nViT-Base\n92.1%\n85.3%\n68.4%\nChannelViT\n94.7%\n89.1%\n73.2%\nChannelViT+HCS\n93.8%\n91.4%\n81.9%\nFIG U R E 4\nNormalized Confusion Matrix: The\nplotnor mali zedconf usionmatrixf unctiongener atedheatmapsof t\n6\n|\nPERFORMANCE PREDICTION\nThe accurate prediction of solar panel performance is\ncritical for optimizing energy production and mainte-\nnance planning. Traditional approaches typically rely\non either image-based analysis or tabular data, but\nrarely both in combination. This study proposes a\nhybrid deep learning model that integrates both im-\nage features and tabular data to predict the maximum\npower point (Pmpp) of solar panels. By combining vi-\nsual and numerical patterns, the model improves pre-\ndiction accuracy.\nThe dataset includes preprocessed images, defect clas-\nsiﬁcations for individual cells, and tabular data extracted\nfrom CSV ﬁles. The model’s performance is evaluated\nusing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE),\nMean Squared Error (MSE), Median Absolute Error\n(MedAE), and the R² score, demonstrating its eﬀec-\ntiveness in predicting solar panel performance.\n6.1\n|\nDataset\nThe dataset consists of three main components:\n– Image Data: Preprocessed grayscale images of so-\nlar panels, including EL (Electroluminescence), UV\n(Ultraviolet), and VIS (Visible) modalities, concate-\nnated along the channel dimension. We use the\n9\nTISO dataset, which contains EL, UV, and VIS im-\nages of 157 solar panels. All images were resized\nto 224 × 224 pixels to match the input size of the\nmodel architecture. Each image was normalized\nusing mean and standard deviation values of 0.5.\n– Tabular Data: Defect classiﬁcations for individual\ncells (as categorical classes) and additional numer-\nical features extracted from the CSV ﬁles.\n– Target Variable: The maximum power point per-\ncentage (Pmpp) of each solar panel, extracted from\nthe CSV data.\nThe proposed model integrates both image and tabu-\nlar data using a hybrid architecture.\n6.2\n|\nModel Architecture\nThe proposed model integrates image and tabular data\nusing a hybrid architecture composed of two branches:\n1. CNN Branch: A ResNet model [2], pretrained on\nthe ImageNet dataset, is used to process the im-\nage data. ResNet (Residual Network) models em-\nploy convolutional layers with residual connections\nto improve training optimization. The ResNet fam-\nily includes several variants with diﬀerent depths.\nIn this study, we use the lightweight architectures\nResNet-18 and ResNet-34, which consist of 18\nand 34 layers, respectively.\n2. Tabular Branch: A fully connected neural network\nprocesses the tabular data, transforming it into a\ndense feature vector.\nThe outputs of both branches are concatenated and\npassed through a regression head, implemented as a\nfully connected neural network, to predict the Pmpp\nvalue.\n6.3\n|\nTraining and Evaluation\nThe dataset is randomly split into training (80%), val-\nidation (15%), and test (5%) subsets. The model is\ntrained using the Adam optimizer with the Mean Squared\nError (MSE) loss function. Training and validation losses\nare monitored to prevent overﬁtting using early stop-\nping with a patience of 10 epochs.\nThe model’s performance is evaluated using the fol-\nlowing regression metrics:\n1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the aver-\nage absolute diﬀerence between predicted and ac-\ntual values.\n2. Median Absolute Error (MedAE): Measures the\nmedian of the absolute diﬀerences between pre-\ndicted and actual values.\n3. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the aver-\nage of the squared diﬀerences between predicted\nand actual values.\n4. R² Score: Indicates how well the model’s predic-\ntions approximate the real data.\nDue to the relatively small sample size, model eval-\nuation is repeated 50 times using diﬀerent random\nsplits of the dataset. The results are then averaged\nacross all runs.\nFigure 16 shows the predicted versus true Pmpp val-\nues on the test datasets from all 50 experiments. The\nscatter plot demonstrates a strong correlation, with\nmost predictions falling close to the diagonal.

Future extensions should consider inte-\n10\ngrating physics-based models of PV cell degradation\nto constrain the feature space and improve general-\nization. The proposed architecture demonstrates >\n80% zero-shot accuracy in controlled tests, establish-\ning a strong baseline for production systems requir-\ning minimal retraining on new PV technologies. This\nstudy demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of integrating\nimage and tabular data for predicting solar panel per-\nformance. The proposed model leverages the strengths\nof CNNs for image processing and fully connected\nlayers for tabular data, achieving high accuracy in pre-\ndicting Pmpp. Future work will explore the inclusion\nof additional features, such as environmental condi-\ntions, to further improve the model’s performance.\n6.

Es ist möglich, hochauflösende Bilder in verschiedenen Wellenlängenbereichen \n(sichtbares Licht, UV, IR) zu nutzen, um diverse Fehlerarten zu identifizieren und zu quantifizieren. \nDiese Herangehensweise stellt eine kosteneffiziente und innovative Methode zur Überwachung von \nAnlagen dar und ermöglicht den Vergleich beschleunigter und/oder nicht beschleunigter \nDegradationsprozesse von PV-Modulen. Das Ziel dieses Projekts ist die Entwicklung einer Methodik \nzur Erfassung von Bildern von PV-Modulen in verschiedenen Wellenlängenbereichen und deren \nanschliessender quantitativer Analyse. Dadurch soll die Zuverlässigkeit solcher Systeme gesteigert \nund das Risiko von Ertragsverlusten minimiert werden. Dies wird durch die Analyse der Bilder mithilfe \nkünstlicher Intelligenz erreicht, wobei die Ergebnisse mit den Leistungsverlusten der Module in \nBeziehung gesetzt werden. Die Nutzung einer einzigen extrem hochauflösenden multispektralen \nKamera mit Empfindlichkeit von UV bis IR ermöglicht eine Beschleunigung und Verbesserung der \nDatenakquirierung, da Unsicherheiten im Zusammenhang mit Fehlern bei wiederholten Aufnahmen \nmit verschiedenen Kameras verhindert werden. Dies ermöglicht die Kombination verschiedener \ndiagnostischer Werkzeuge für eine effiziente Auswertung einzelner Defekte. Der Einsatz von \nmaschinellem Lernen und Analysen der Feature Importance anstelle von analytischen Modellen geht \nüber den aktuellen Stand der Technik hinaus. Damit wird die quantitative Analyse des Einflusses \nverschiedener Fehlerarten ermöglicht, die aus Feldexposition und künstlichen Alterungsexperimenten \nresultieren. Die Ergebnisse werden direkte Auswirkungen auf die zukünftige Methodik zur \nDefekterkennung haben, sowohl in Forschungslaboren als auch in Produktionsumgebungen. Dies \nbietet eine quantitative und messbare Möglichkeit, die Entwicklung der Modulleistungen zu \ndokumentieren. \n \nRésumé \nL'énergie photovoltaïque est essentielle à la réduction d’émissions de carbone et les systèmes \nphotovoltaïques deviennent de plus en plus fiables et ceci grâce, entre autres, à l'augmentation \nsignificative du nombre d’installations. Les images à haute résolution désormais disponibles dans \ndifférentes largeurs de bande (visible, UV, IR) peuvent être utilisées pour identifier et quantifier les \ndéfaillances, et fournissent au même temps un système innovant et économique de monitorer et \ncomparer la dégradation accélérée ou pas des modules photovoltaïques. Ce projet vise à développer \nune méthodologie pour l'acquisition d'images de modules photovoltaïques dans différentes largeurs de \nbande et à les analyser quantitativement afin d'augmenter leur fiabilité et réduire les risques de perte \nde rendement. Cet objectif sera atteint en analysant les images à l'aide de l'intelligence artificielle et \nen corrélant ces résultats avec les pertes de rendement des modules. L'utilisation d'une caméra \nmultispectrale à très haute résolution avec une sensibilité allant de l'UV à l'IR permet d’une part \nd'accélérer la phase d'acquisition à des délais raisonnables et, d’autre part d'éviter les incertitudes \nliées aux erreurs pour les prises de vue multiples avec différentes caméras ainsi que de combiner \ndifférents outils de diagnostic nécessaires pour une évaluation efficace des défauts individuels. Cette \nnouvelle approche permettra d'analyser quantitativement l'impact des différents modes de défaillance \nprovenant de l'exposition sur le terrain et des expériences de vieillissement artificiel sur la \nperformance de la cellule. Les résultats auront un impact direct sur la future méthodologie de traçage \ndes défauts, tant dans les laboratoires de recherche que dans les milieux de production, ce qui \npermettra saisir de manière quantitative et mesurable l'évolution des performances des modules. \n \n4/30 \nSummary \nPhotovoltaic (PV) energy is critical to reducing carbon emissions, and the reliability of PV systems is \nbecoming increasingly important as the number of systems installed grows. High-resolution images in \ndifferent bandwidths (visible, UV, IR) can be used to identify and quantify failure modes, providing a \ncost-effective and innovative way to monitor and compare accelerated and/or non-accelerated \ndegradation of PV modules. The aim of this project is to develop a methodology to acquire and \nquantitatively analyze images of PV modules in different bandwidths in order to increase the reliability \nof such systems and reduce the risk of yield loss. This will be achieved by using artificial intelligence to \nanalyze the images and correlating the results with module performance losses. The use of an ultra-\nhigh-resolution multispectral camera with sensitivity from UV to IR makes it possible to speed up the \nacquisition phase to reasonable timings, to avoid uncertainties related to errors in multiple shots with \ndifferent cameras, and to combine different diagnostic tools needed for efficient evaluation of \nindividual defects. The use of machine learning and feature importance analysis instead of analytical \nmodels goes beyond the state of the art, as it will allow quantitative analysis of the impact of the \ndifferent failure modes arising from field exposure and artificial aging experiments on cell performance. \nThe results will have a direct impact on the future methodology for failure tracking in both research \nlaboratories and production environments, allowing the evolution of module performance to be \nrecorded in a quantitative and measurable way. \n \n \n5/30 \nContents \nZusammenfassung ............................................................................................................. 3 \nContents ............................................................................................................................ 5 \nAbbreviations .................................................................................................................... 6 \n1 \nIntroduction ................................................................................................................. 7 \n1.1 \nBackground information and current situation ............................................................. 7 \n1.2 \nPurpose of the project ................................................................................................. 8 \n1.3 \nObjectives .................................................................................................................... 9 \n2 \nProcedures and methodology ..................................................................................... 10 \n2.1 \nData acquisition: hardware ........................................................................................ 10 \n2.2 \nDatasets .................................................................................................................... 10 \n2.3 \nSegmentation ............................................................................................................ 13 \n2.4 \nUnsupervised labelling with UMAP ............................................................................ 15 \n2.5 \nRendering of the results and expert labelling ............................................................ 15 \n3 \nActivities and results ................................................................................................... 16 \n3.1 \nWP2 Instrument setup and calibration and data acquisition ...................................... 16 \n3.2 \nWP4 Data Preprocessing and annotation ................................................................. 19 \n4 \nEvaluation of results to date ....................................................................................... 27 \n5 \nNext steps ................................................................................................................... 28 \nReferences ........................................................................................................................ 28 \n \n \n \n \n6/30 \nAbbreviations \nAI \nArtificial intelligence \nCNN \nConvolutional neural network \nCOCO \nCommon objects in context \nEL \nElectroluminescence \nFAIR \nFacebook AI Research \nFMEA  \nFailure mode effect analysis \nGB  \nGigabyte \nGPU  \nGraphics processing unit \nHAR  \nHail resistance test \nHDBSCAN \nHierarchical density-based spatial clustering \nIEC \nInternational electrotechnical commission \nIR \nInfrared \nJSON  \nJavaScript object notation \nLeTID \nLight and elevated temperature induced degradation \nMAST  \nModule accelerated sequential testing \nMB  \nMegabyte \nMpx \nMegapixel \nOFI \nÖsterreichisches Forschungsinstitut für Chemie und Technik  \nPC \nPersonal computer \nPID \nPotential induced degradation \nPL \nPhotoluminescence \nPV \nPhotovoltaic \nRAM \nRandom access memory \nR&D \nResearch and Development \nResNet \nResidual Network \nRGB  \nRed green blue \nROI \nRegion of interest \nt-SNE \nt-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding \nTISO \nTicino solare \nTÜV \nTechnischer Überwachungsverein \nUMAP  \nUniform manifold approximation and projection \nUS  \nUnited States \nUV  \nUltraviolet \nVGG \nVisual geometry group \nVI \nVisual inspection \nVPN  \nVirtual private network \nWP \nWork package \n \n \n \n \n \n7/30 \n1 \nIntroduction \n1.1 \nBackground information and current situation \nPhotovoltaic energy is a crucial source for decarbonization: The continuous increment of temperature \nwitnessed in the Alps (+2°C with respect to the reference average 1961-19901) is the echo of the \nworldwide phenomenon of climate change caused mainly, if not exclusively, by greenhouse gases \nemissions. Among renewable sources, photovoltaic energy is crucial in order to reach zero net carbon \nemission, both in terms of cost competitive price and energy market penetration in the last years2. The \nexplosive trend in price reduction of this technology has been possible thanks to a mix of constant \nimprovement in cell efficiency, industrial optimization, and economies of scale, but important steps in \nterms of lifetime enhancement are needed in order to grant the lowest levelized cost of electricity. \nPresently, the typical warranty for Photovoltaic (PV) modules is set to 25 years, but an extension to 35 \nyears and beyond is already requested by the European strategical plans3. \nThe reliability of photovoltaic modules has been initially verified through accelerated testing based \nupon the ones identified by the JPT in the late seventies, where five testing blocks of solar modules \nwere used to lay the foundation for the international electrotechnical commission (IEC) approval testing \nstandards, necessary to bring on the market safe and reliable products4. The IEC 61215 and 61730 \nstandards remained basically unchanged for several years, until the explosive evolution of the market \nand the first massive failures of PV panels led to an important update in 2016, with more demanding \ntesting sequences being developed to ensure the 25 years’ lifetime frame, the standard for warranty5. \nThe research of the optimal acceleration to detect failures at the earliest possible time is pursued \nfurther by the IEC technical committees, who are now working on a revision of the IEC 61215 and \n61730 standards much faster than the previous update, to cover new defects coming from new \ntechnologies (such as PID6, LeTID7, updated UV test to detect backsheet weaknesses8). The solar \nindustry as well is looking for new formulas to grant defect free production and increase the warranty \nterms: some examples of the improvement of quality checks beyond IEC standards are the PV module \nreliability scorecard by PV Evolution Lab, the Thresher test sequence proposed by TÜV Sud \n(Technischer Überwachungsverein Süd), the MAST (Module accelerated sequential testing) approach \nfrom Dupont and the production approach by Sunpower, based upon FMEA (Failure mode effect \nanalysis) for the prioritization of test development9. In September 2020 Violet Power, a US startup \nfounded by the former R&D responsible of ARCO Solar, one of the pioneering PV manufacturers, \nannounced for the first time a 50 years’ warranty term, based upon a vertically integrated production, \nwith all its steps under direct control and extended accelerated testing10. The new layouts and \nconcepts subjected to standard and accelerated testing are showing some critical patterns, for \nexample for hotspot sensitivity on bifacial11 and shingled cells12. On the other hand, even though the \ninstalled systems with high-efficiency modules are relatively young, their rate of degradation is strongly \nrelated to cell degradation which can be thoroughly investigated also through electroluminescence \n(EL) and photoluminescence (PL) 13.  \nFor all of the above reasons, the opportunity to use high-resolution images on different bandwidths \n(Visible VI, Ultraviolet UV, Infrared IR) to identify and quantify the appearance of failure modes as \nproposed in the present project represents a very promising way to achieve a cost wise and innovative \ninstrument to monitor and compare the accelerated and/or not accelerated degradation of PV \nmodules. The failure modes will be automatically identified and classified by means of machine \nlearning algorithms. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been used to successfully solve the task \nof classifying images in different application fields, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have \nbeen proved to achieve very good performance14. CNNs use multiple filters sliding over the image and \ndetecting certain patterns and spatial context. An additional advantage of CNNs is the transfer \nlearning capability, meaning that CNNs which are trained for another image related task, i.e., already \nlearned certain patterns, can be used, and adjusted to the problem at hand, which can reduce training \ntime significantly15. Once deployed, the algorithms allow to identify the objects automatically in new \ndata not yet seen by the model. \n \n8/30 \nIn the field of failure modes classification in photovoltaics, machine learning has been employed \nmainly for the analysis of EL images16,17. In these studies, EL images of the PV modules have been \nsegmented to extract the single cells as a basic unit and these were classified into good functioning \nand defected ones. In some cases16,18,19, the defected solar cells have been classified into more than \none failure mode (e.g. cracked, corroded and so on), but every image could belong to just one class \n(e.g. a cracked cell could not be identified as also corroded). This is a limitation for PV modules that \nalready experienced some aging, as the appearance of more than one failure mode per cell cannot be \nexcluded. In the field of thermography, a Naive Bayes classifier has been trained on infrared (IR) \nimages to carry out hot-spot diagnosis on full PV modules20. This approach, however, requires \nextensive feature extraction, does not provide information at the cell level and is not able to distinguish \nbetween different failure modes. The manual annotation of failure modes is known to be subjective. In \nthis study21, two different operators identified an average 1.4 and 2.8 defects per PV module, \nrespectively.  \nAt present, PV modules are guaranteed to retain 85% of the nominal power after 25 years of \noperation, but a longer lifetime of PV modules would help to reduce the price of the PV generated \nelectricity. Understanding how the different failure modes affect the module performance is therefore \nof great importance. Several studies22–24 describe the types of failure modes occurring in degraded PV \nmodules. Some attempts have been done to analytically model the degradation of PV modules, and a \nreview of them can be found in23. Such analytical models, however, rely on assumptions and \nsimplifications that limit their employment in real settings and suffer from a lack of generalization \ncapability. In22 an equivalent-circuit model is used in combination with optoelectronic measurements to \nanalyze the different contributions to the output power losses. The approach presented by the authors \nin22 requires an extensive characterization of the PV modules, involving invasive procedures as the \nextraction of encapsulant samples for carrying out the optical measurements. The characterization has \nbeen done for two PV modules, and scaling up this methodology for a higher number of modules is \nunlikely.  \n1.2 \nPurpose of the project \nThe aim of this project is to define a new methodology for the quantitative and prompt analysis of \ndefects and failures in PV modules through image analysis in combination with the use of artificial \nintelligence algorithms and their correlation to module performance losses. The use of a unique \nextremely high-resolution multi-spectral camera with sensitivity from UV to IR, appropriate filters and \nlight setup, and a single shot for each defective PV module, will allow to speed up the acquisition \nphase to reasonable timings, avoiding uncertainties related to errors for multiple shots with different \ncameras and keeping the strength of combining different diagnostic tools needed for an efficient \nevaluation of single defects.  \nOur approach aims at going beyond the state of the art by developing a methodology for the automatic \nidentification of failure modes using a five-channel multispectral image composed of data coming from \ndifferent measurements: visual inspection, electroluminescence, and photoluminescence. The \nemployment of data coming from more than one experimental technique allows for the identification of \na wider spectrum of degradation modes, which is particularly important for the application of the \nmethodology to modules exposed to aging in a real environment. To achieve the project goals, a \nmethodology for the automatic identification of failure modes at cell level will be implemented using \nCNNs. The algorithm will be trained on the natural aged cells of the TISO (Ticino solare)25,26 plant \nthen, in order to shift the picture to current technologies, multiple sets of recent modules with naturally \naged defects on the field will be evaluated with the same criteria. The machine learning algorithms will \nbe applied and evaluated in terms of capability to detect the relevant failure modes of TISO and new \nones, typical of the new cell/module technologies. Moreover, the identification of more than one \ndegradation mode in one solar cell will be enabled, making a quantitative analysis of the impact of the \ndifferent failure modes on the module performance possible. The developed methodology will also \nreduce the subjectivity that affects the manual annotation of failure modes. In our approach, care will \n \n9/30 \nbe taken in the annotation of the training dataset. Afterwards, the deployment of the trained model will \nenable a quantitative comparison of data coming from different modules measured at different times. A \nrelease of experimental data is planned within the proposed project in order to further enable \nadvancing in this field. In a second step, the developed methodology will be applied also on modules \nsubjected to artificial aging. Considering data coming from both modules exposed in the field and ones \nsubjected to artificial aging is a key point of the present project, as accelerated aging cannot fully \nreproduce all the failures originated during field exposure24. \nThe employment of machine learning and feature importance analyzes instead of analytical models \n(such es in the studies22–24 discussed in section 1.1) goes beyond the state of the art as it will enable \nto quantitatively analyze the impact of the different failure modes originating in field exposure and \nartificial aging experiments on the cell performance. Moreover, the approach presented in the present \nproject overcomes the need of invasive procedures as it is easily scalable while providing quantitative \ninsights on the degradation mechanisms of PV modules. \nThe results of the project will have a direct impact on the future methodology to trace defects, both in \nresearch laboratories and in production environment, allowing a quantitative and measurable way to \nrecord the evolution of module performances. \n1.3 \nObjectives \nThe present project pursues the following objectives:  \n• \nDevelop a methodology to enhance the standard visual inspection procedure included in IEC \nstandards, in order to provide a detailed and comprehensive documentation of the PV \nmodules before, during intermediate steps and at the end of the accelerated aging \nprocedures. \n• \nDevelop a methodology for the automatic identification of failure modes in solar cells and \nmodules using artificial intelligence.  \n• \nDevelop a data fusion strategy to combine images coming from different experimental \ntechniques into one multichannel image. \n• \nQuantitatively identify the failure modes affecting at most the performance of naturally and \nartificially aged modules, respectively.  \nIn order to achieve these goals, the following research questions will be addressed: \n• \nWhat are the optimal settings in order to achieve the best resolution to detect defects in the \ndifferent wavelengths? What are the best settings to optimize signal-to-noise ratio? \n• \nWhich model based on convolutional neural networks achieves the better accuracy in \nidentifying failure modes in crystalline silicon solar cells? \n• \nWhat is the contribution of the different channels into identifying the failure modes? \n• \nWhat is the relevant importance of the different failure modes in the degradation of the \nperformance of the modules? How does this change in the different technologies? \nThe advancement of the project will be measured with the following measurable targets: \n• \nDatasets of raw multispectral images of at least 230 modules. \n• \nDatasets of annotated images. At least 30% of the images are labelled by experts. \n• \nAt least 90% accuracy in failure identification by machine learning prototypes for labelled data. \n• \nAt least 70% accuracy in failure identification by machine learning prototypes for unlabelled \ndata (tested by experts). \n \n10/30 \n• \nIdentification of the top two failure modes that affect module performance. \n2 \nProcedures and methodology \n2.1 \nData acquisition: hardware \nThe choice of image capture device has been focused on the need to have the highest possible \nresolution, in order to increase the ability to digitally zoom into the images, with the possibility of \ndeepening the analysis in specific areas and avoiding the stitching of photos, thus reducing \ncomputational effort and digital artifacts. \nIn the first phase, a model was chosen that represents the highest resolution multispectral digital \nsensor on the market: the iXM-MV150, with a 150 Mpx sensor, equipped with a Linos 60 mm f/4 lens \nand manual focus (Figure 1). In a preliminary phase, before the project was awarded, Phase One \noffered a trial period with a similar 100 Mpx camera, the results of which were very satisfactory. \na)\n   \nb)\n \nFigure 1: Picture of the PhaseOne multispectral camera: body (a) and lenses system (b). \nGiven the size of the files (870 MB), it has also been necessary to invest in a PC with an adequate \ngraphic card, RAM and solid-state drive, so that the images can be easily opened, processed and \nstored. \n2.2 \nDatasets \nDuring the first year of the project several datasets of EL images have been employed in order to \nsetup and test the preprocessing pipeline before as the data acquisition system for the multi-spectral \nimages has been setup, calibrated and tested.  \nEL datasets \n1.

In this project, instance segmentation \nhas been used to identify the exact position of each cell in the modules. \n \nFigure 7: Classification: There is a balloon in this image. Semantic Segmentation: These are all the balloon pixels. Object Detection: \nThere are 7 balloons in this image at these locations. The model accounts for objects that overlap. Instance Segmentation: There are 7 \nballoons at these locations, and these are the pixels that belong to each one of them29. \nIn this project, Detectron230 has been used for the image segmentation task. Detectron2 is an open-\nsource computer vision framework by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) based on PyTorch (Figure 8). It's \ndesigned for efficient object detection and segmentation model development, offering pre-trained \nmodels and modular components. It consists of several key components, including a backbone \nnetwork (e.g., Residual Network ResNet), feature pyramid network, and task-specific heads for object \ndetection and segmentation31.  \n \nFigure 8: Schematic architecture of Detectron2. The backbone network provides feature maps (P1–P5) to the region proposal network. \nThe ROI (Region of interest) head locates bounding boxes (bbox) and segments (mask) objects, together with the corresponding class \n(in our case just one class cell)32.  \nDetectron2 is already pre-trained with the COCO33 (Common Objects in Context) data set and is able \nto recognize various shapes and patterns. However, in order to use the model to segment solar cells, \nthe model must be fine-tuned with images of solar cells. As different technologies of solar panels are \nbeing analyzed within the project, the model needs to be trained with them, as the shape and nature of \n \n14/30 \nthe cells differs from one technology to the other. For each technology, at least one image that is as \nrepresentative as possible must be provided, and the segmentation must be carried out manually by a \nperson. The online tool VGG (Visual geometry group) Image Annotator has been employed for this \nmanual masking task (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via.html). \na)\n \nb) \n \nFigure 9: (a) Example of one manually masked TISO image. (b) Example of a new TISO image segmented with Detectron2. \nThe image and the mask evaluated manually are then used for training. Figure 9a shows one image \nfrom the TISO dataset taken as an example. Other technologies, such as the Infinity dataset, have \nbeen used for training. Before the segmentation, each TISO image is cut so that only the module is \nvisible, resulting in 6925 × 2000 pixels images. The trained Detectron2 model can then be used for new \nTISO photos to automatically segment their cells (Figure 9b). The results of the segmentation and of \nthe labelling (described in section 2.4) are displayed in a web application described in section 2.5. In \norder to provide better navigation functionalities in the web application, an overview with all the \nsegmented cells identified with progressive numbering is also produced during the segmentation step. \nAn example for the TISO dataset is shown in Figure 10. In order to reduce the amount of data to be \ntransferred, the overview is scaled by a factor 0.5. Each single segmented cell is then classified \nindividually, which is why the corresponding segment image section for each individual cell is saved \nindividually in the original resolution (approx. 1000 x 1000). \na) \n b)\n \nFigure 10: (a) Overview of a segmented TISO image. (b) Segmented individual TISO cell, ready for further analysis. \n \n \n \n15/30 \n2.4 \nUnsupervised labelling with UMAP \nThe first step in the preprocessing of the data is a semi-automatic labelling of the data with the \nalgorithm UMAP (Uniform manifold approximation and projection)34. UMAP is a dimensionality \nreduction technique based on Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. According to the authors, \nthe algorithm has a good visualization quality and has better performance while preserving the global \nstructure of the data better than other comparable algorithms such as t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic \nneighbor embedding)35. The data are preprocessed as follows: \n• \nPixels are scaled between 0 and 1. \n• \nA pre-trained VGG1636 network is used to extract relevant features from the images. VGG16 \nis a relatively shallow network based on convolutional neural networks with 16 trainable \nlayers. It achieves very good performance on the ImageNet37 classification task and with 4.2 \nms per inference step on a GPU it is a relatively fast model. The model is loaded with the \nImageNet weights, and the top classification layer is removed, a common practice when this \npre-trained network is used as a feature extractor. \n• \nSubsequently, a global pooling layer is applied to the VGG16 features to reduce their number \nto 512. \n• \nThe resulting 512 features are given to UMAP as an input. UMAP produces unsupervised \nembeddings in 10 or 20 dimensions, depending on the input dataset. A two-dimensional \nembedding is also evaluated for visualization purposes. \n• \nHDBSCAN (Hierarchical density-based spatial clustering)38 is used to cluster the high \ndimensions UMAP embeddings. HDBSCAN provides density-based hierarchical clustering, \nand it is used to find groups of solar cells images with similar features. This process is also \ncompletely unsupervised. The results of the clustering are projected in 2D for visualization \npurposes.  \nA Dash39 application has been programmed to visualize the results of the unsupervised labelling and \nto provide each cluster with a label. The following requirements had to be met: \n• \nQuick development and easy maintenance. \n• \nIntegration of interactive plots. \n• \nGood integration with existing Python code and Jupyter notebooks. \n2.5 \nRendering of the results and expert labelling \nAs mentioned, three photos (Visual, EL, UV) were taken for each solar panel, each approximately 1 \nGB in size. This results in very large amounts of data that require a suitable storage location, \naccessible quickly and easily by all project participants. The decision was made to utilize the FFHS \nSharePoint, with VPN (Virtual private network) access set up for SUPSI. The underlying OneDrive \nsynchronization of the SharePoint enables automatic syncing of data across the PCs and servers of all \nproject participants. \nAdditionally, a software solution was needed for the labelling of panels and their cells by experts. This \nsoftware should allow convenient display of panels and cells, as well as filtering based on various \ncriteria (e.g., technology, error category, etc.). To ensure continuous accessibility for all project \nparticipants, a Mac Studio Server was set up at FFHS, reachable via VPN by SUPSI researchers. In \norder to display the segmented cells and their classification predicted by the model, a simple web \ninterface was developed using Flask. Flask40 is a popular Python web framework used to develop web \napplications. It is simple, lightweight, and flexible, making it an excellent choice for building small to \nmedium-sized web applications. Flask can be used to create a basic web service by writing a few lines \nof code in Python. The web interface offers the user a quick and easy way to view the different solar \npanels and navigate to the single cells in order to check, or if necessary correct, the classifications \n \n16/30 \nmade by the model. The user can look at entire modules, can zoom into certain image areas to take a \ncloser look at parts of the modules, and can also look at individual segmented cells and classify them.  \n3 \nActivities and results \n3.1 \nWP2 Instrument setup and calibration and data acquisition \nParticular attention has been paid to creating an effective and reproducible setup. For visual \ninspection and UV photoluminescence, the focus of the Linos lens has been precisely calibrated and \nfixed at a common point, while for the electroluminescence image, i.e. infrared light, a different set \npoint has been verified, to optimize accuracy: the two settings were fixed as points on the focus ring to \nbe able to quickly reproduce the same conditions for each module. As shown in Figure 11, this small \ndifference in focus is mainly due to the phenomenon of refraction. \n \n \n \nFigure 11: near IR focus shift vs VIS and UV41 and specs of the Qioptiq LINOS lens, optimized for 400-750nm (VIS). \nThe logistics have also been carefully evaluated, to optimize the handling of hundreds of samples and \nto maintain the best repeatability of the images. \nThe first solution considered has been to use the existing visual inspection setup used in the lab, \nconsisting of a horizontal table with 1000 lux illumination with the camera placed above it, but the \ninterference with ongoing lab services, the stray light and the variable environmental conditions, have \nled to the multispectral setup being placed in a dedicated room, which was finally identified in the rear \npart of the dark room, with the advantage of a controlled environment and the absence of reflections \nthanks to the special black paint used to reduce them even in the IR range. The camera distance can \nbe varied according to the dimensions of the module, in order to completely fill the sensor and make \nthe most of the camera's high resolution.  \nFor the visual inspection setup, two flash units have been purchased with dedicated rectangular soft \nboxes to evenly distribute the light over the wide surfaces of the modules. The flashes have been \nprecisely positioned at a 45° angle to the surface of the module to avoid glass reflections. A color \nchecker table is positioned on top of the modules, to grant full traceability of the color space, so to be \nable to quantify properly e.g. the yellowing rate of materials or the oxidation of silver-plated busbars. \nThe UV cut filter in front of the lens does not affect image quality and is relevant to the UV induced \nphotoluminescence setup described below. \n \n17/30 \na) \n b)   \n \n \nFigure 12: Schematic view of visual inspection setup (a) and photoluminescence one (b). \n \nFor the UV induced photoluminescence setup, the same approach has been used, positioning 4 UV \nlamps (emission at 365 nm) at 45° and actively using the UV filter to remove the UV reflection: indeed, \nthe UV light excites plastic materials, e.g. encapsulants, triggering re-emission of photons in the visible \nrange, highlighting moisture penetration, cracks affecting the solar cells and possible other defects. \nThe electroluminescence phenomenon is based on the impression of the digital sensor by near IR \nphotons coming from the use of the solar cells as IR LEDs: a power supply is connected to the PV \nmodule under inspection (positive to positive, negative to negative) so to bias the circuit in order to \nallow current flow and the consequent IR emission from the cells. The setup, illustrated in Figure 13 for \nwhat concerns the camera and filtering means, adds a power supply to the other two acquisition \nmethodologies, being electroluminescence the only one using direct light coming from the samples \nand not reflected or re-emitted irradiation. The accurate focus of electroluminescence images is far \nmore complicated than the visible ones, due to the low level of light and higher noise in the so called \n“live view” mode for long-term exposures, where a digital magnified area is used to fix the optimal \nsharpness. \n         \n \nFigure 13: Schematic view of electroluminescence setup, overall view of the setup in the dark room. \nA set of remotely controlled switches have been implemented (Figure 14), in order to efficiently semi-\nautomate the process, activating separately the different shooting setups, that is: \n1) The two flashes to take the VI images. \n2) The power supply to take the EL images in the IR wavelength. \n \n18/30 \n3) The 4xUV lamps to capture the module’s emitted photoluminescence. \n4) A spotlight to change modules. \n \nFigure 14: Remotely controlled electric switches for rapid selection of the light sources during data acquisition. \nIn order to limit at the maximum the amount of strain visible light through the use of IR filters and to \nautomate also the process of changing between different wavelengths, a motorized filter wheel has \nbeen as well procured, in order to have the possibility to switch remotely between different filters: the \nsetup in the dark-room is beneficial in this sense, but the use of this device can be appropriate when \nthe setup is moved, e.g, in front of the air compressed cannon, to damage in controlled conditions the \ncells.  \nAt the moment, 3 filters are available, 1 UV lens, and 2 IR filters for 2 different wavelengths. \nThe UV filter has been permanently applied to optimize image quality in the UV photoluminescence to \nfilter the UV radiation from the spots at 365 nm with a high-pass filter that cuts at 385 nm, as can be \nseen in Figure 15. \na) \n b) \n \nFigure 15: Photoluminescence image without (a) and with (b) UV filters. \nIn the frame of the ACHILLES project, the controlled damage of PV modules is aimed at reproducing \nthe results of hailstorms in laboratory controlled conditions and to accelerate the results of it, to \nevaluate the consequences in terms of safety and energy yield. To use the important synergies with \nthe EAGLE project, it has been decided to prepare an additional setup next to the hail shooting stand. \nIn this case, the use of high-resolution electroluminescence pictures is crucial to determine the \nweakest points (e.g. micro defects at cell level) to trigger crack formation. The electroluminescence is \nthen used also to record the results and proceed faster to the next hail shoot. As it can be seen in \nFigure 16, the position outside of the dark room requires in this case appropriate light filtering in order \nto have a proper use of the camera for good quality results. \n \n19/30 \n \nFigure 16: Hail resistance test (HAR) setup for controlled damage of PV modules. \n3.2 \nWP4 Data Preprocessing and annotation \n \nSegmentation \nThe segmentation using Detectron2 needs to work for various technologies, with cells differing in \nshape, size, and position. In order to reduce the computation effort and the labelling needed to \nsegment a new technology, the existing model needs to be augmented with each new technology to \navoid training a completely new model for each individual technology. For this purpose, a sample \nimage for each new technology has been manually segmented, as described in section 0. This \nsegmentation is then added as a JSON (JavaScript object notation) entry to the existing JSON file \ncontaining information about all the already analyzed technologies. With this expanded JSON \ndefinition, the existing model is retrained, enabling it to subsequently segment panels of various \ntechnologies. Figure 17 shows two example panels whose segmentation was performed using this \nmodel. It can be observed that the cells for both the TISO panel (Figure 17a) and the Achilles panel \n(Figure 17b) were segmented relatively accurately. \n \na)\n \n \n20/30 \nb)\n \nFigure 17: (a) Overview of a segmented TISO image. (b) Overview of a segmented Achilles image \n \nUnsupervised labelling \nFrench et al. Dataset \nThe results of the pipeline described in section 2.4 for the first dataset is depicted in Figure 18.

(c) Representation of \nthe second set of cropped images projected onto the UMAP embeddings. \nIn order to test the robustness of the method with respect to translation, a test was performed with \ndifferent crops of the images. All the crops have the same lateral sizes but are shifted with respect to \none another (Figure 19a). The embeddings are evaluated on the first set of crops (Figure 19b) and the \nsecond set of crops is projected onto the same space (Figure 19c). The images of the second set \nclasses (crop 2) belonging to different classes are still well separated, proving that the method is \nrobust with respect to translational shifts, which is to be expected due to the employment of \nconvolutional neural networks in the preprocessing. The test has been repeated for different offsets of \nthe crops, as well as with crops coming from a different set of images (test set). In all the experiments, \nthe good and corroded images are well separated. \n2. Chen, Crack segmentation dataset \nThe unsupervised labelling routine has been applied to the second dataset of EL images. As several \ntechnologies are represented in the dataset, a first round of UMAP effectively separates the different \ntechnologies into six different clusters (Figure 20a).  \n \na)\nb) \nc)\nd)\ne) \n \nf) \ng)\nh) \n \nFigure 20: (a) Two-dimensional projection of the 20-dimensional embeddings and clusters found on the full dataset (global average \npooling). (b-g) Examples of cells coming from the different clusters. (h) Examples of cells not assigned to any cluster. \nCrop 1 \nCrop 2 \n \n22/30 \nWhen global average pooling was used during preprocessing, 318 images (approximately 1% of this \ndataset) were not assigned to any cluster. This is due to the fact that a tradeoff has to be found when \nchoosing the HDBSCAN parameters in order not to have a significant number of very small clusters. \nThanks to the Dash application, it is possible to visualize the small groups of images not assigned to \nany cluster, and it is therefore possible to assign them to a specific technology. Figure 20a-g show two \nimages from each technology cluster, and Figure 20h depicts as some examples of images not \nassigned to any cluster. \nThe same analysis has been performed using global max pooling in the preprocessing. The results are \nshown in Figure 21a. 1607 images (around 5.4% of the dataset) were not assigned to any cluster. \nHowever, almost all of these images could be assigned to the same HDBSCAN cluster. 90 images \nformed a separate unidentified subcluster, and they could also be assigned to one cluster. Using \nglobal max pooling leads to the formation of eleven clusters in the UMAP embeddings. Some of the \ndifferent clusters belong to the same technology, but different failures have already been separated \nfrom each other. (e.g. Figure 21g and h and Figure 21i and l). \n \na)\nb) \nc) \n d) \n e) \n f)\ng) \nh) \n i) \n l) \nm) \n n) \n \nFigure 21: (a) Two-dimensional projection of the 20-dimensional embeddings and clusters found on the full dataset (global max pooling, \nn_neighbors=50). (b-n) Examples of cells coming from the different clusters. \nThe analysis routine has been repeated using the images of the technology represented by Figure \n21f-h (10043 images) to evaluate 10-dimensional embeddings and to evaluate if the routine is \neffective in separating good and defected cells. 460 of these images also have labels, which are only \nused for the evaluation. Label 0 (blue) corresponds to good cells, while labels 2-6 correspond to \ndifferent failures such as cracks, crosses and dark areas on the cells, as well as combinations of them. \nFigure 22a shows that good cells are quite well separated from defected cells, apart from a small \nnumber of cells presenting cracks or crosses. Some defects or combinations of defects are clustered \ntogether, as it can be seen from Figure 22b. The orange cluster in Figure 22b has been analyzed in \nFigure 23 with the Dash application. After zooming into this region, the cells belonging to this cluster \nare selected and visualized. The screenshot only shows some of the cells visualized. All cells of this \ncluster present the cross failure, and some of them also present cracks and darker regions. No intact \ncell is represented in this cluster.  \n \n23/30 \nIt is worth noting that the pipeline fails on multicrystalline Si technologies, which however will not be \nthe focus of the present project. \n \na)\nb)\n \nFigure 22: (a) Two-dimensional projection of the 10-dimensional embeddings found for one technology (n_neighbors=50).

The area relative to the orange cluster (bottom links in Figure 22b) has been zoomed, \nand the cells selected and visualized. \n3. Infinity project \nThe preprocessing pipeline has been applied to the Infinity dataset as well. The embeddings have \nbeen evaluated on 90% of the dataset, and the rest of the images have been projected in the same \nembedding space. Several clusters of images have been identified, as shown in Figure 24a. Some \ndefects have been well separated (e.g. Figure 24b and e), while some contamination is present in \nother clusters (e.g. Figure 24f and l). It is however worth noting that images with similar features tend \nto be close to one another in the embedding space, which could reduce the labelling effort even if \nsome manual intervention is needed. Figure 25 shows how the test images (not used for evaluating \n \n24/30 \nthe embeddings) are separated into clusters. Even if some contamination is present, the different \ndefects are well separated. \na)\nb)\n c)\n d) \n e) \n \nf) \n g) \n h)\n i)\n l)\n \nFigure 24: (a) 2-dimensional embeddings of the EL images of the infinity project evaluated on 90% of the dataset.

This dataset is much \nmore complicated than the previous one for the following reasons: \n• \nThe modules have aged naturally in outdoor conditions for many years and present therefore \nseveral types of defects. \n• \nAll three channels consist of RGB images, which are more complex than single channel \ngrayscale EL images. \na) \n b) \n c) \n  d) \n  \ne)\n \n \nFigure 26: 2-dimensional embeddings of the TISO EL images.

(b – e) Examples of cells coming from different clusters. \n \n26/30 \nThe segmented TISO images have been downscaled in resolution to 224x224 pixels for this \npreliminary analysis to reduce the computational effort. Each spectral channel has been considered \nseparately. Figure 26a shows the 2-dimensional embeddings evaluated with the TISO EL images. \nSome defects are separated quite well and are depicted in Figure 26b, c and d. The big green cluster \ncomprises cells in different conditions (Figure 26e). It is worth noting however, that also in this case \ncells looking similar to each other tend to be next to each other in the embeddings space. A similar \nbehavior can be observed for the UV images, as shown in Figure 27. The unsupervised routine can \ndifferentiate cells having a different predominant color, however the big blue cluster in Figure 27a \ncomprises cells with different characteristics. Also in this case, cells which are close to one another in \nthe embedding space look similar (Figure 27d). \n \nWeb Interface \nFigure 28 shows a screenshot of the Flask web application. On the left, the solar panels are listed in a \ntree structure, grouped by technology. The user can filter this list according to his/her wishes, for \nexample to only look at certain technologies or only certain classifications (e.g. good, cracked cells \nand so on). By clicking on the name of the panel, the corresponding images (VI, UV, EL) are displayed \non the top-right area. \n \nFigure 28: Screenshot of the initial view of the web application. \n \nFigure 29: Example of a zoomed TISO cell. \n \n27/30 \nMoving the mouse cursor over one of the three images results in the corresponding area being \ndisplayed larger in its full resolution. This makes it easier to identify the defects in individual cells. Each \ncell is uniquely identified by the module name and cell number. Figure 29 shows an example where \ncell number six is zoomed and shows visible burns. \nThe tree structure on the left of Figure 28 allows to easily navigate to each single cell of a module and \nto either classify it or change the label provided by the model. The user has to identify himself before \nbeing able to perform a classification. As cells can present more than one failure, up to three defects \ncan be attributed to one cell, as shown in Figure 30. \n \nFigure 30: Example of an unclassified TISO image. Up to three defects can be attributed to the cell. \n4 \nEvaluation of results to date \nThe first part of the project was dedicated to the setting up of the test stand. Several measures have \nbeen implemented to produce an efficient acquisition flow of images. The 172 TISO modules have \nbeen processed in the complete multi-spectral range in 4 days. The use of multi-spectral imaging in \nfront of the hail test setup is also aimed at increasing the efficiencies in terms of test execution and \nhas allowed to discern micro defects, otherwise not detectable, responsible for crack propagation. The \nprocedure included in the technical specification IEC TS 60904-13 will be evaluated in terms of \nnecessary steps and time needed to have a proper acquisition. \nThe segmentation pipeline works well. The time needed for preprocessing the full TISO dataset and \nupload the segmented images is around 11 hours, which means that the images are ready for further \nprocessing on the following day. An alternative routine is currently under investigation in order to \nfurther reduce the initial annotation required when new technologies with cells of different shapes are \nmeasured. \nThe qualitative evaluation of the unsupervised labelling based on UMAP and HDBSCAN shows that \nthe pipeline is promising for reducing the labelling necessary for training an artificial intelligence model. \nThe pipeline works better for some technologies and does not provide good results for cells made of \npolycrystalline silicon, which are not the focus of the present project. Sometimes the pipeline fails to \nidentify clear defect clusters and cells with different peculiarities are grouped together. In this case \nhowever, cells that look similar to one another are close together in the feature space. The Dash \napplication can be modified to output the relative paths of the selected cell in addition to the images. \nThis way, subgroups of similar cells could be easily labelled together. It is also worth noting that a \nmodel based on CNN will be trained (supervised learning) in a subsequent step. This means that only \n \n28/30 \na limited number of labelled cells representative of the different failures is needed as output of the \nunsupervised routine. The preliminary analysis performed on the multichannel images shows that \nsome optimization in the pipeline is needed, as the RGB images are richer in information with respect \nto the grayscale EL images used for prototyping.  \nThe developed web interface is user-friendly and allows an efficient navigation through the different \ntechnologies, modules and individual cells. The different users can identify themselves to keep track of \nwho created or modified the labelling of each specific image. The implementation with Flask allows for \nthe rapid developing of new features if additional requirements arise during the project. \n5 \nNext steps \nNext year, the partial labelling of the available datasets should be finalized in order to start with the \nactivities of WP5. Within this Work package (WP), a supervised classificator will be trained to \nautomatically recognize the different failures. This model can be then directly employed when new \nimages of the same technologies are acquired. Moreover, the module statistics and performance \nanalysis will be carried out. \nModules from different technologies will be measured with the multi-spectral camera and analyzed \nwith the developed routines. The synergies with existing projects will be further exploited: as explained \nin section 3.1, the ACHILLES project on the evaluation of hailstorms’ risks, offers opportunities to \nrecord images of artificially and naturally damaged modules. A dedicated setup next to the \ncompressed air hail cannon has been prepared and, in the next year, a series of non-destructive and \ndestructive tests will be planned. Different patterns of cracks due to hail damage will be recorded in a \nwide range of old and new technologies, using modules coming from the field and spare modules \nacquired in the frame of RACONT project, where 7 different types of mainstream technologies have \nbeen procured. It is worth to mention that, in August 2023, a massive hailstorm has hit the region of \nLocarno, damaging severely a huge number of PV plants. The SUPSI PVLab has provided support to \nthe several requests received from installers and final users, asking to receive samplings of modules \nwith intact front glass: in this way a wide variety of modules subject to a real phenomenon have been \nand will be subjected to the analysis defined in EAGLE project. A stand dedicated to outdoor \nacceleration of the damaged modules is planned as well to further differentiate the evolution of defects \nin time and increase the number of datasets. \nReferences \n1. \nMeteoSchweiz.

A privilege has been granted to LwNet over SqueezeNet and GoogleNet, in terms of classification\nperformance and time saving efficiency.\n1. Introduction\nRecently, a tremendous development has been witnessed in the field\nof solar energy based on utilizing technologies of photovoltaics (PV).\nThe huge demand on solar systems is vastly growing and becoming\nwidespread in domestic as well as commercial applications [1–3]. PV\nmodules are widely spread on all continents. According to the report\nreleased by the International Energy Agency (AEI), the global PV-based\ninstalled systems grew significantly in 2022 [1], reaching about 1,185\nGW of installed cumulative capacity according to preliminary market\ndata. The installation of new systems has been increased by about 240\nGW with penetration exceeding 10 %. The Chinese market continues to\ndominate approaching a total capacity of about 414,5 GW, which is\nmore than double that in Europe. European countries have continued a\nstrong growth with 39 GW installed, led by Spain (8,1 GW), Germany\n(7,5 GW), Poland (4,9 GW) and the Netherlands (3,9 GW). The American\nmarket engaged up to 18,6 GW PV capacity, while Brazil nearly doubled\nits PV systems approaching 9,9 GW. Other countries like India, Korea\nand Australia have demonstrated a strong growth in PV installations\ncapacities. Such a tremendous growth urged the demand on developing\nsmart technologies for defect detection and classification in PV systems.\nThis aids the assessment of the operating PV module on site and permits\nto take proper arrangements while saving labor and time resources [3].\nSolar cells today are mostly made of silicon with two types available,\nthe mono- and poly-crystalline cells (denoted as mc-Si and pc-Si,\nrespectively). Their energy conversion efficiency approaches 30 %\nwith a privilege being granted to pc-Si cells [4]. However, these cells\nmay suffer from various anomalies like finger-interruptions, discon-\nnections, cracks, breaks, etc. Such defects can seriously affect the output\npower of the PV module [4,5]. To evaluate the PV degradation, the\ncharacterization methods can be applied using the I–V curve acquisition\nof the PV module’s electric properties. Ultimately, imaging methods like\ninfrared (IR) or electroluminescence (EL) techniques are able to visu-\nalize the PV module properties [6].\nOn the other hand, deep learning has gained a tremendous attention\nas an efficient approach for detecting and classifying faults in solar cells\nand PV systems as well. Deep neural networks (DNN) have remarkably\npushed the development of detecting and classifying the various PV\nE-mail address: hazem-ot@just.edu.jo.\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\nSolar Energy\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/solener\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2024.112803\nReceived 9 June 2023; Received in revised form 24 June 2024; Accepted 22 July 2024\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n2\nanomalies to another peak. Specifically, convolutional neural network\n(CNN) approaches were implemented to provide more reliable results in\ndiagnosing these faults [7–22]. In EL imaging, early methods were\ndevoted to the detection of PV faults by classifying the PV panel into\nhealthy or defective without categorizing the defect type. In [7], Bartler\net al. generated a dataset, taken form 98,280 cell images, by applying\ncropping operations on the EL images with a postprocessing stage via\ndistortion-perspective correction. The effect of oversampling and\naugmentation was developed to override the imbalanced source dataset.\nTransfer-learning algorithm was deployed in a binary classification\nmode using the pretrained VGG-16 network [8] with an average accu-\nracy of about 92 %. In [9], Balzategui et al. classified EL images into\n“degraded” and “non-degraded” categories using a CNN-based model.\nThe approach classified the cells into either flawed or flawless cells. A\nsliding window was adopted to reduce inadequate data size. Simulations\nshowed an accuracy of about 85 %. In [10], Otamendi et al. utilized\nmultiple data resources and augmentation techniques to develop an end-\nto-end deep learning pipeline that could detect, locate, and segment PV\nmalfunctions using EL images of the PV cells. Simulations showed good\nperformance with an accuracy of about 84 %. In [11], Prabhakaran et al.\nproposed an efficient method, denoted as real-time multi variant DNN\nmodel (RMVDM), to identify and localize PV panel defects like cracks,\nmicro-cracks, dust accumulation, finger interruptions, and spotlight.\nThe scheme was tested using captured grayscale images of the tested PV\npanels. In [12], Xie deployed a network with CNN architecture to clas-\nsify the solar cell into normal or cracked. Here, an attention-based\ntransfer learning, supported with a class-aware domain discriminator,\nwas proposed to improve the performance of the transferred-based CNN\nmodel. The proposed approach achieved a good recall of about 84.7 %\nand a high precision of about and 90.2 %.\nOther research works pushed the classification of the PV anomalies,\nbased on EL imaging, to another peak. Here, the approaches were\ndeveloped to detect and classify PV cell defects into various categories.\nIn [13], Karimi et al. proposed an approach to classify EL images of the\ncells’ defects into corroded, cracked, and good cells. The classification\nwas based on utilizing random forest (RF), support vector machines\n(SVM) and CNN-based deep learning. In [14], Tang et al. developed data\naugmentation using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to reduce\nthe effect of imbalanced datasets as well as to avoid overfitting. The\nutilized dataset contained 4 classes: microcrack, finger-interruption,\nbreakage, and flawless. Results showed that the deployed DNN model\nexhibited a testing accuracy of about 83 % which was higher than other\nexisting tested models (VGG-16, MobileNet, ResNet-50 and Inception-\nV3). In [15], Tang et al. utilized a 4-class scenario, with 250 images\nper class, to classify the EL images. The approach divided the utilized\ndataset into four classes and applied a CNN-based network with an\nachieved accuracy of about 92 %. In [16], Lin et al. proposed two light\nCNN models with resulting precision and recall of around 99.4 % and\n98.8 %, respectively. However, the results were obtained using a dataset\nwith only mc-Si type of PV cells.\nHowever, in the prescribed works [13–16], the employed datasets\nwere different which makes the task problem specific, and it would be\ninadequate to compare the achieved performances. Recently, a well-\nprepared dataset was published and can be used as a benchmark for\nvisual inspection of PV cells in EL imagery [17]. This dataset is available\npublicly and was named as ‘ELPV’. Lately, many research works were\ncarried out based on utilizing the ELPV dataset. In [18], Deitsch et al.\nproposed a CNN-based model for analyzing cells’ defects using their EL\nimages provided by the ELPV dataset. Here, EL images were classified\ninto non-defected, possibly normal, possibly defected and defected.\nResults showed an average accuracy approaching 88.5 %. In [19],\nAkram et al. developed a light CNN model, based on utilizing the ELPV\ndataset, with an achieved accuracy around 93 %. In [20], Demirci et al.\nproposed an automatic framework that was denoted as deep feature-\nbased\n(DFB)\nmethod.\nA\ntransfer-based\nlearning\napproach\nwas\ndeployed by involving VGG-16, VGG-19, DarkNet-19, and ResNet-50\nmodels. Results showed high classification accuracies of around 90.6\n% when considering four classes. In [21], Zhao et al. proposed to deploy\nthe high-resolution network (HRNet) for PV defect detection. The\napproach was based on replacing the classification layer of the HRNet by\na proposed self-fusion network (SeFNet). The proposed SeFNet exhibited\nbetter performance in terms of the feature fusion of the multi-resolution\ninformation in the EL image of the investigated PV models. Another\nwork that utilized the ELPV dataset is the work of Korovin et al. [22].\nThey proposed an efficient deep-learning-based defect detection and\nclassification model using EL imaging. The introduced model (denoted\nas SeMaCNN) was based on the concept of the Mahalanobis distance that\ncan be trained using an imbalanced dataset in a semi-supervised mode.\nThe proposed model has accomplished an accuracy and F1-score of\nabout 94.6 %, and F1-score, respectively. However, the number of\nclasses was limited to 2 and 3 during model verification.\nA close analysis of the surveyed literature, one may note the\nfollowings:\n1- Different EL image datasets were utilized in various research works.\nThis makes the archived results be problem specific. However, there\nare few works that were based on using the prescribed published\nELPV dataset.\n2- In most of the previous works, the classification approaches were\nbased on collecting mc-Si and pc-Si cells, having the same features, in\nthe same class. In fact, mc-Si and pc-Si cells have different features\n(under EL imaging) and this adoption may lead to erroneous sample\nannotations within each class as well be seen later.\n3- Despite of the good achievements in the field of DNN-based PV cells’\nclassification, however, there is still a potential for further de-\nvelopments. Possible directions can be elaborated by a) providing\nbetter preparation of the utilized dataset to avoid overfitting, b)\norganizing proper categorization of the available classes for the\nanomalies of the PV cells’ defects, and c) designing light-weight\nCNNs that provide a compromise between DNN classification per-\nformance and complexity costs.\nConsequently, the current research is oriented toward bridging the\ngap in research in the field of classification of the PV anomalies. The\ncurrent research is proposed to deploy CNN-based models for detection\nand classification of defects in PV cells using EL imaging. The adopted\nmethodology is based on utilizing transfer learning of well-known DNNs\nand developing a light-weight multi-scale CNN-based model for fault\ndetection and classification.\nThe remainder of this article is arranged as follows: In Section 2,the\nconcept of the EL imaging and the PV modules is introduced including\nthe adopted ELPV dataset. In section 3, the main methodology is\ndescribed, in detail, including the modified dataset and the proposed\nCNN-based models. In section 4, experimental results are elaborated and\ndiscussed, while, in section 4, concluding remarks are outlined.\n2. EL imaging of the PV modules\n2.1. ELPV imaging\nEL imaging is a fast and relatively inexpensive technique for spatially\nresolved and non-destructive analysis of PV modules [23]. Normally,\nwhen the cell is forward biased, it emits energy in the wavelength range\nof 1100-nm range. A specialized CCD-camera is used to capture this\nemitted energy and construct the so called EL image. Typically, the\nwhole process is elaborated in a dark chamber to ensure a high system\nresolution [24]. Illustrative examples on EL images are shown in Fig. 1.\n(randomly selected from ELPV [17]).\nUsing EL imaging, different types of defects can be recognized in PV\ncells. This includes cracks, microcracks, finger-interruptions, discon-\nnected cells, diode failure, soldering defects, etc. Such anomalies and\ndefects may diversely affect the PV cell and its normal operation and\nH. Munawer Al-Otum\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n3\nmay lead to create hotspots with severe power loss or even total failure\n[24]. Consequently, an urging demand is raised to develop automatic\nprocedures for defect inspection and classification using EL imaging\nsystems.\n2.2. The ELPV dataset\nAs prescribed, the ELPV dataset was created by Buerhop-Lutz et al.\nand is available on their GitHub repository [17]. This dataset contains\naround 2,624 EL images, about 1116 samples were considered as non-\ndefective, while 1508 samples were considered as defective. The\nincluded faults include various types ranging from micro-cracks to\ntotally disconnected cells. Due to the complexity in detecting the precise\ndegree of the PV defect, the defect likelihood was assigned for each cell\naccording to the anticipated cell damage probability. In ELPV, image\nsamples are categorized into four classes, according to the level of the\ndefect associated with each cell. Thus, the cell annotations were adopted\nas being (non-defected), 33 % (possibly normal), 66 % (possibly defec-\nted) and 100 % (defected). To simplify our task, the prescribed classes\nwere annotated as ND (non-defected), PN (possibly normal), PD\n(possibly defected) and DF(defected). Fig. 2 depicts the distribution of\ncells per class in the original ELPV dataset.\n3. Methodology\nIn this work, an efficient approach is proposed to be used for defect\nFig. 1. Selected EL images (from the ELPV dataset) for: a) mc-Si, and b) pc-Si cells.\nFig. 2. The distribution of the PV cells per class in the original ELPV dataset.\nH. Munawer Al-Otum\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n4\ndetection and classification of solar cells, based on utilizing EL imaging\nanalysis. The experiments were elaborated on the ELPV dataset after\nbeing modified to override overfitting during training, as well as to\nproperly classify cells (mc-Si and pc-Si) into relative classes. Two sce-\nnarios were adopted: a 4-class and 8-class classification approaches. The\ndeveloped models are based on either transfer-based deployment of\npretrained DNNs (SqueezeNet and GoogleNet), or on a developed light-\nweight CNN approach (denoted as LwNet). The methodology is devel-\noped in the following stages: a) preparing the modified balanced ELPV\ndataset, b) classification of malfunctions in EL Images using the pro-\nposed CNN models, and c) evaluation tests of fault detection and\nclassification.\n3.1. Preparing the modified ELPV dataset\nReferring to the cells’ distribution in the original ELPV dataset\n(Fig. 2), it is clear that:\na) the number of samples per class is imbalanced with about 57.5 %,\n11.2 %, 4.0 %, and 27.2 % of the total number of samples in ND, PN,\nPD and DF classes, respectively. However, this imbalanced distri-\nbution usually leads to overfitting during the training stage.\nEvidently, there is a shortage in having large datasets with a\nbalanced number of samples in each class. This situation occurs in\nmost of the practical real-world aspects. when implemented in DNN-\nbased classification models, this creates restrictions to afford high\nperformance. To handle this situation, the ELPV dataset is to be\nmodified to obtain almost balanced number of samples per class\nusing proper data augmentation. Data augmentation aims at\nincreasing the number of samples while preserving its original label.\nA simple and straightforward procedure for data augmentation is\nobtained by applying simple image processing operations to each of\nthe input samples. In this work, data augmentation has been per-\nformed using various operations like image translation, flipping,\nrotation, resizing, gray level adjustments, histogram equalization,\nnoise addition, and random cropping.\nb) Each class contains both mc-Si and pc-Si cells with, again, imbal-\nanced number of samples. In fact, panels made of pc-Si cells are\ncheaper than that of the mc-Si panels, however, they are less efficient\nand aren’t as aesthetically pleasing. Here, the captured EL images of\nthe pc-Si cells have a grained (dirty) surface due to its internal\nconstruction. This is clearly seen when comparing the EL images in\nFig. 1.a, and Fig. 1.b. The approach of combining both types of cells\nin one class may mislead the appropriate classification of cells into\nproper classes. To accurately tackle this issue, it is advised to split the\nmc-Si and pc-Si cells into separate classes that consider the properties\nof each type of the Si cells.\nConsidering the prescribed concerns, the ELPV data set has been\nmodified by applying proper augmentation along with splitting the mc-\nSi and pc-Si samples into separate classes. For instance, the ND class has\nbeen split into two subclasses with non-defected mc-Si (mc-ND) and\nnon-defected pc-Si (pc-ND) cells. The other three classes are treated\nsimilarly. This produces 8-classes, are annotated as: mc-ND, pc-ND, mc-\nPN, pc-PN, mc-PD, pc-PD, mc-DF, and pc-DF. The distribution of samples\nin each class of the modified balanced ELPV dataset is depicted in Fig. 3.\nNote that the portion of samples per class is about 12.5 %. For com-\nparison purposes, classes with similar anomalies have been recombined\nto produce a balanced 4-class ELPV dataset with about 25 % of samples\nper class.\n3.2. Classification of malfunctions in EL images using CNN models\nRecently, CNNs attracted a great attention in the field of deep\nlearning applications. CNNs are a special type of DNNs that are partic-\nularly suited for structred data (like images). CNNs are used for image\nrecognition and various processing tasks. On the other hand, transfer\nlearning approaches can be utilized, where pre-trained CNN models are\nused as the starting step for another classification task. With transfer\nlearning, a deep learning model can be trained using small datasets\nbecause the model has already been pre-trained, hence, the training time\ncan be intensely decreased, when compared to training time consumed\non the training stage from scratch. In this work, two approaches are\nproposed for classification of EL images, the former is based on using a\nlearning-from-scratch approach and is based on developing a light-\nweight CNN network, whereas the latter is based on transfer learning\napproach. Here, two pretrained DNNs were selected, one with a medium\ndepth (SqueezeNet), while the other is with a high depth (GoogleNet).\nThese approaches are described below in detail.\n3.2.1. LwNet for fault classification in EL images\nTo meet the tradeoff between DNN efficiency and accuracy, a light-\nweight multi-scale CNN (LwNet) is proposed. LwNet is inspired by the\narchitectures of SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, and AlexNet [20,25–27]. The\nmain features of the proposed LwNet are based on utilizing the relatively\nnew deep learning components like the leaky relu activation function,\nthe 1x1 convolution layer as well as the dropout unit. Moreover, the\narchitecture of LwNet is constructed of three steps as shown in Fig. 4. At\nthe initial step, the size of the convolution kernels are selected to be\nrelatively small accompanied by the leaky relu activation function to\nFig. 3. The distribution of PV cells, per class, in the modified balanced ELPV dataset.\nH. Munawer Al-Otum\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n5\ncapture the tiny features and keep a small portion of the negatively\nachieved features. This led to enhance the performance of the proposed\nLwNet. At the intermediate step, convolutional layers have larger ker-\nnels to capture more features at a different scale. At the final step, again,\n1x1 convolution is reused to confine missed features at the intermediate\nstage. To speed up the model, a dropout layer is added before using the\nfully connected layer. These topics are discussed in detail below.\nA detailed architecture of the LwNet is depicted in Fig. 5. Clearly, it is\nconstructed of 26 layers, and takes place in three stages: initial, inter-\nmediate, and output stages. The proposed LwNet has the following key\nfeatures:\n1) LwNet utilizes various types of convolutional filters to aid capturing\nimage features at different scales. Here, two classes of convolutions\nwere adopted, namely:\n• At the initial stage, small-sized convolutional filters (1x1 and 3x3)\nwere used. At this stage, the spatial features are dominating which\ngives an ability to speed up the suggested network as well as to have a\nsmaller receptive field. Moreover, LwNet utilized the concept of\nusing multiple types of filter, with different sizes, on the same image\nblock (1x1 and 3x3 kernels). This was inspired by the concept of the\ninception module in the GoogleNet model [25].\n• At the intermediate stage, medium-sized convolutional filters (5x5\nand 7x7) were used. This gives privilege to extract features at larger\nscales. Evidently, features extracted from large kernels would be\ngeneric and spread across the image. This concept was inspired by\nthe AlexNet and the GoogleNet models [20,25].\n2) In LwNet, the conventional relu activation function was replaced by\nthe leaky relu. Actually, the relu activation function can be written as\n[27]:\nf(x) =\n{\nx, ifx > 0\n0, othrewise\n}\n(1)\nWhile, the leaky relu is adopted to be as [27]:\nf(x) =\n{\nx, ifx > 0\n0.01x, othrewise\n}\n(2)\nThe insertion of a small negative slope in the leaky relu (Fig. 6), when\ncompared to the relu function (Fig. 6), made it possible to override the\n“dying ReLU” problem, hence, improving the overall DNN performance.\n3) A dropout layer has been employed at the final stage of LwNet.\nDropout insertion boosts acting on multiple pathways for prediction.\nWhen no dropout being utilized, the the forward propagation can be\nperformed according to:\nz(l+1)\ni\n= w(l+1)\ni\nyl\ni + b(l+1)\ni\ny(l+1)\ni\n= f(z(l+1)\ni\n),\n(3)\nWhere\nz(l+1)\ni\n- the i-th output of layer (l + 1) before activation\nyl\ni– the i-th output of layer l.\nw(l+1)\ni\n– the i-th weight of layer (l + 1).\nb(l+1)\ni\n– the bias of layer (l + 1).\nf(.)– the used activation function.\nWhile, when the dropout layer is included, these equations will be\nmodified as:\nr(l)\nj\n∼Bernoulli(p)\ñy\n(l) = y(l)*r(l)\nz(l+1)\ni\n= w(l+1)\ni\ñy(l) + b(l+1)\ni\ny(l+1)\ni\n= f\n(\nz(l+1)\ni\n)\n(4)\nWhere\nr(l)- a vector of independent Bernoulli random variables with prob-\nability of 1 (at layer (l)).\ñy(l)– the output of layer (l) obtained as a result of dot multiplication\nof y(l) of and r(l).\nHence, before calculating the vector z, the input to the layer is\nmultiplied with the independent Bernoulli variables r that act as a mask\nto the input variable. This leads to keep only a few units according to the\ndropout rate. The dropout is deployed to prevent overfitting on the\ntraining data. When no dropout is used, the initial batch of training\nexcessively influences the whole process, leading to overfitting. At the\npresence of dropout, the network is encouraged to learn more robust and\ngeneralized features. Thus, dropout adds a randomness behavoiur dur-\ning training, which advances the network to rely on multiple pathways\nfor prediction. In LwNet, the dropout layer has a dropout rate of p = 0.2,\ni.e., about 20 % elements of the input tensor, being randomly selected,\nare set to zero during the training phase. A demonstrative example on\nthe dropuout concept is shown in Fig. 7.\nIn the initial stage, the input image is applied to a parallel combi-\nnation of convolutional layers (conv1_1 and con1_2) with a kernel size of\n1x1 and 3x3, respectively. As a result, elementary features like shape\nand boundary can be captured at both 1x1 and 3x3 scales. The outputs of\nFig. 4. The block diagram of the proposed LwNet.\nH. Munawer Al-Otum\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n6\ntheses layers are applied to batch normalization layers (batchnorm1_1\nand batchnorm1_2) to improve the model performance and stability. By\nstandardizing their outputs, the model learns faster while reducing\npossible network overfitting. The outputs of batchnorm1_1 and batch-\nnorm1_2 are applied to the activation leaky relu layers (leakyrelu1_1 and\nleakyrelu1_2), respectively with a constant gradient α (in LwNet α = 0.1.\nThe outputs are applied to maxpooling layers (maxpool1_1 and max-\npool1_2) that are used to decrease the dimension of the inputs, coming\nfrom leakyrelu1_1 and leakyrelu1_2, based on the statistics of neigh-\nboring cells. This leads to extract more learned features and improve the\nmodel performance. This stage ends by applying the maxpooling outputs\nto a depth concatenation layer (depthcat_1) that concatenates the inputs\nFig. 5. The block diagram of the proposed LwNet.\nH. Munawer Al-Otum\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n7\nalong the channel dimension. On the intermediate stage (see Fig. 5), the\nconcatenated output is applied to parallel convolution layers (conv2_1\nand conv2_2) with kernel sizes 7x7 and 5x5, respectively. In fact, the\ninsertion of parallel convolutional branches with various kernel sizes\nallows to capture a wide variety of features ranging from elementary to\nspecific textures and patterns. Similar to steps taken in the initial stage,\nthe output of the convolutional layers are applied, in a parallel mode, to\nbatch normalization layers (batchnorm2_1 and batchnorm2_2), leaky\nrelu layers (leakyrelu2_1 and leakyrelu2_2 with α = 0.1) and maxpooling\nlayes (maxpool2_1 and maxpool2_2), respectively. This stage ends by\ncombining the parallel outputs in the depthcat_2 layer.\nAt the final stage, the depthcat_2 output is applied, sequentially, to\nconvolutional (conv_3), batch normalization (batchnorm_3), and relu\nactivation (relu_3) layers. Here, conv_3 utilizes a 1x1 kernel for\nimproved fine features extraction. The output of the relu layer is applied\nto a dropout layer. Here, some of the neurons are dropped or omitted\nrandomly with a dropping rate of 0.2. The insertion of this layer is used\nto reduce overfitting in DNNs models. Usually, overfitting arises when\nthe size of the available data fro training is limitted which leads the\nnetwork to shows higher training accuracy than the testing accuracy.\nNext, fully connected layer (fc) is used to perform the decision step on\nthe LwNet. The fc layer is constructed of a multi-layer perceptron. It can\nlearn weights utilized in categorizing object classes. The output of the fc\nlayer is applied to the softmax activation function which is adopted as\nthe readout layer for multivariate classification tasks. Finally, the output\nis applied to the classification layer (classoutput) that calculates the loss\nusing the the cross-entropy and implies the number of classes from the\noutput size of the previous layer. For more info, the hyperparameters of\nthe proposed LwNet are depicted in Table.1.\n3.2.2. Transfer learning-based fault classification in EL images\nTransfer learning is a process where a pre-trained DNN model, is\nretrained on a new problem. Here, one or more layers from the initially\ntrained model are then used in the new DNN model for training on the\ntask of interest. Transfer learning gained popularity in DNNs especially\nwith comparatively little datasets. The adoption of transfer learning\nleads to a significant drop in the required training and computational\npower. In this work, two pretrained DNNs were selected in a transfer\nlearning mode to be applied to the ELPV dataset, the former is the\nSqueezeNet with a medium size having 68 layers, and the latter is the\nGoogleNet with relatively a high number of layers (144 layers). The\ndetails on these DNNs are given below:\n1. SqueezeNet: is a DNN designed to be small while being highly ac-\ncurate. It was developed in 2016 by researchers from DeepScale, UC\nBerkeley, and Stanford University [24]. SqueezeNet employs a\ndesign strategy known as channel squeezing and deep compression\nto reduce the number of parameters, remarkably with the use of fire\nmodules that “squeeze” parameters using 1x1 convolutions. The\nmain feature of SqueezeNet is that it provides a balance between low\ncomplexity and high accuracy, making it an ideal choice for devices\nwith limited resources like embedded systems and mobiles. Squee-\nzeNet is a CNN-based network with a medium number of layers (68)\nand depth of 18 that can classify images into 1000 object categories.\nA crucial feature that attracted our attention to deploy the Squee-\nzeNet is its promising architecture, especially in scenarios where\ncomputational resources are limited. SqueezeNet is considered as an\nexcellent\nchoice\nfor\nedge\ncomputing\nscenarios,\nwhere\nboth\nFig. 6. a) relu, and b) leaky relu activation functions [27].\nFig. 7.

This can be attributed\nto the usage of 1 × 1 (point-wise) filters, to replace 3 × 3 filters, in\nbottleneck fashion to reduce both net depth computational energy,\nwith applying late down-sampling to keep a big feature map. By\nminimizing computational requirements, it enables AI applications\neven in resource-constrained environments.\n2. GoogleNet: is a DNN designed based on the inception architecture\nwhich is used to approximate the CNN optimal local sparse structure.\nIt utilizes various filter types, on a single block of the image, instead\nof using a single filter size. The utilization of the inception module\nleads to decrease the number of parameters to only 5 million. It has\n144 layers, so it is a very deep network [25].\nUndoubtedly, the GoogleNet model provides several key features\nover previous state-of-the-art winners AlexNet, ZF-Net, and VGG ar-\nchitectures [20,25]. GoogleNet exhibits significant decrease in error\nrate. Again, the utilization of 1 × 1 convolutions leads to parameter\nreduction and depth increase as well. Moreover, GoogleNet employs\nglobal average pooling to replace the fully connected layers at the\nnetwork end. Here, a distinctive feature of GoogleNet is the embedding\nof the so-called inception module, where the 1 × 1, 3 × 3, 5 × 5 con-\nvolutions, and 2 × 2 max pooling are stacked together to generate the\nfinal output. This approach allows the network to handle objects at\nmultiple scales effectively.\nIt is worthy to note that the main reasons behind selecting the\nSqueezeNet and GoogleNet for EL image classification is attributed to a)\nthe superior trade-off between classification capabilities and computa-\ntional power, b) the feasibility to be trained on a single-GPU computer,\nand c) up to our knowledge, neither SqueezeNet nor GoogleNet was\ndeployed for EL image classification using the ELPV dataset.\n4. Experimental results and discussion\n4.1. Preparations\nIn this section, the transfer-based learned SqueezeNet, GoogleNet\nalong with the proposed LwNet models are tested using several experi-\nments. Conducted experiments were carried out using a computer with\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 2.30 GHz., 16 GB RAM memory\nwith NVIDIA GeForce MX250 graphics unit (single-GPU). The tests were\nexecuted using the Deep Learning Toolbox in MATLAB® R2020a. Here,\nthe amount of training data used for validation is 20 % of the prescribed\nmodified ELPV dataset during the training stage. The prescribed DNNs\nwere trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a\nlearning rate n = 10−\n4. The proposed LwNet was trained using 50\nepochs, while only 30 epochs were assigned to train the pretrained\nSqueezeNet and GoogleNet. Table.2 lists the training parameters utilized\nin the evaluations.\n4.2. Evaluation metrics\nTo evaluate the performance of the prescribed DNNs, four metrics\nwere utilized, namely: the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The\naccuracy is a measure of the DNN performance among all classes. The\nprecision reflects the percentage of the predicted faults that were clas-\nsified properly, The recall determines the percentage of the actual faults\nthat were correctly categorized, while F1-score defines the harmonic\nmean of precision and recall. These metrics are [20]:\nAccuracy =\nTP + TN\nTP + TN + FP + FN\n(5)\nPresision =\nTP\nTP + FP\n(6)\nRecall =\nTP\nTP + FN\n(7)\nF1 −score = 2 P×R\nP + R\n(8)\nWhere, TP, TN, FP, and FN denote the true positives, true negatives,\nfalse positives, and false negatives, respectively.\n4.3. Results for classification of anomalies in EL images using the 4-Class\nmethod\nIn this section, a 4-class approach is investigated. As prescribed, mc-\nSi and pc-Si cells, with similar anomalies have been combined to pro-\nduce 4 classes (denoted as ND,PN,PD and DF) in the modified balanced\nELPV dataset with about 25 % of samples per class. In fact, this classi-\nfication scenario was adopted by other researchers in previous works\n(for instance, in [14,18,20]). The obtained experimental results for the\ntested DNNs are illustrated in Fig. 8 for the accuracy (Fig. 8.a), precision\n(Fig. 8.b), recall (Fig. 8.c), and F1-score (Fig. 8.d). In Fig. 8.a-d, the\naverage values (for all classes) are also depicted.\n4.4. Results for classification of anomalies in EL images using the 8-class\nmethod\nThe current test was conducted by splitting the dataset into 8-classes\ndepicted in Fig. 3. The mc-Si and pc-Si cells, with similar anomalies,\nwere split into separate classes. The obtained experimental results for\nthe tested DNNs are illustrated in Fig. 9 for the accuracy (Fig. 9.a),\nprecision (Fig. 9.b), recall (Fig. 9.c), and F1-score (Fig. 9.d). In Fig. 9.a-d,\nthe average values (for all classes) are also depicted.\nTo investigate the classification performance in case of simultaneous\nexistence of mc-Si or pc-Si cells, it would be useful to demonstrate the\nresults for the accuracy and F1-score as shown in Table.3. For better\ncomparison, the last column illustrates these metrics in case of the ex-\nistence of both mc-Si and pc-Si cells based on the 8-class scenario.\n4.5. Discussions and comparisons\nIn this section, the achieved faults’ classification results are assessed\nand compared with results obtained using other, recently published,\nworks. Moreover, recommendations are given with demonstrative ex-\namples on the achieved classification performance.\n4.5.1. Results’ analysis and discussion\nAnalyzing the performed tests on the prescribed DNNs (Fig. 8 and\nFig. 9), one may note that:\n• When adopting the 4-class method for classification, a moderate\naccuracy has been achieved using the prescribed DNNs. In case of\nusing the 4-class approach, average accuracies around 73.62 %,\n85.13 % and 85.47 % were achieved using GoogleNet, SqueezeNet\nand LwNet, respectively.\n• In case of adopting the 8-class classification method, the average\naccuracy has been increased to be 94.56 %, 93.95, and 96.21 % using\nGoogleNet, SqueezeNet and LwNet, respectively. All prescribed nets\nTable 2\nAdopted training parameters.\nParameter\nProposed LwNet\nSqueezeNet\nGoogle Net\nNumber of Classes\n4 vs. 8\n4 vs. 8\n4 vs. 8\nUsed Solver\nSGDM\nSGDM\nSGDM\nInti.

Munawer Al-Otum\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n9\nperformed excellent when adopting the proposed 8-class method\nwith a privilege granted to the proposed LwNet.\n• When considering the other three evaluation metrics, it is easy to\nreach a similar conclusion that indicates the advantage of using the\nproposed 8-class approach. For better understanding and visualiza-\ntion, these metrics are depicted with improvement percentage in\nTable.4. Clearly, the LwNet exhibits almost stable performance in\nrespect to the precision, recall and F1-score Moreover, there is a clear\nand good improvement, in all the four evaluation metrics, when\nusing the 8-class method over what is possible using the 4-class\nmethod (ranging from 8.8 to 21.0 % according to the used DNN).\nThis can be attributed to the fact that the splitting of the EL images of\nthe solar cells into mono and poly classes led to extract the tiny\ndifference between m-Si and p-Si cells with operational anomalies.\nDespite that these recommendations are valid for the ELPV dataset,\nthey can also be generalized to other EL image datasets.\n• When considering only one type of solar cells (either mc-Si or pc-Si),\nresults indicated that the performance (in terms of the accuracy and\nF1-score) is higher in case of the simultaneous existence of the mc-Si\ncells (see Table.3). In case of the simultaneous existence of the pc-Si\ncell, results were slightly reduced. This is attributed to the better mc-\nSi cells’ surface clarity which enabled the DNN to attain better\nclassification. Clearly, results in case of the existence of both types is\nthe average from both types.\n4.5.2. Comparison of the computational energy\nApparently, the training of a DNN model is a time-consuming pro-\ncedure. Generally speaking, the associated operations required for\ntraining modern DNNs outpaces the computational capabilities, espe-\ncially when GPU are exhaustively utilized. To compare the required\ncomputational power, the prescribed DNNs were trained using MAT-\nLAB.2020.a software on a computer with a single GPU (see section 3.1).\nThe average normalized elapsed time for both 4-class and 8-class ap-\nproaches is depicted in Table.4. Clearly, the 4-lcass method consumed\nslightly higher time than the 8-class method (2 %-6%) for all the pre-\nscribed DNNs which strengthens the proposition of adopting the 8-class\nmethod for classification. Moreover, GoogleNet consumed the highest\nelapsed time with SqueezeNet came in the second position. The pro-\nposed LwNet consumed the lowest computational time with a reduction\nof about 40 % of the maximum time consumed to perform training using\nGoogleNet. This was expected, due to the fact that LwNet is a light-\nweight DNN. When considering the obtained highest LwNet average\naccuracy, it is proper to recommend adopting the LwNet as a superior\nnetwork for EL image classification.\nFig. 8. Experimental results of EL images’ anomalies (using the 4-class method) for the tested DNNs in terms of the: a) Accuracy, b) Precision, c) Recall, and d)\nF1-score.\nH. Munawer Al-Otum\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n10\nFor a better understanding, it is worthy to note that the elapsed time\nconsumed to train the GoogleNet model, in case of the 4-class scenario,\nwas 336 min, and 45 s. This is the highest time consumption among all\ntrained DNNs (see Table.5). Nevertheless, the whole training process is\nusually performed offline before the actual utilization of the trained\nnetwork.\n4.5.3. Illustrative examples\nFor better illustrations, Table.6 depicts demonstrative examples on\nthe predicted labels of randomly selected samples (from the testing\ndataset). The random selection of samples was adopted just to show the\nDNNs performance and, of course cannot be used to give an overall\njudgment. Nevertheless, the number of misclassified samples is obvious\n(in case of the 4-class method), also, the erroneous classification is also\nnoticeable with the GoogleNet.\n4.5.4. Comparative assessment\nTo demonstrate the validity of implementing the prescribed DNNs,\nthe achieved results are compared with state-of-art DNN models. For\nreasonable analysis, the comparative assessments were performed with\nworks that utilized the ELPV dataset. Proper examples are the DNNs\npresented in [14,18,20,22]. Comparisons are provided in Table.7. Here,\nworks in [14,18,20] utilized a 4-class classification mode, while the\nwork in [22] utilized 3-class scenario (named as A, B and C).\nUp to or knowledge, no prior works were elaborated using an 8-class\nmodel. Analyzing Table.7, its clear that the prescribed DNNs exhibited\nbetter performance (except for the recall in [20]). Furthermore, the\nassumption of using the 8-class approach (with the ELPV dataset) led to\noutstand other compared existing models which fortifies the proposed\nidea of this research.\n4.5.5. Research contributions and recommendations\nThe main contributions of this work can be outlined in the following:\n1- Developing an efficient light-weight multi-scale CNN model to be\nutilized for malfunctions’ detection and classification in EL images\n(denoted as LwNet). The proposed LwNet exhibited an excellent\naccuracy performance in classifying faults in EL images and provided\na compromise solution in terms of the performance and the\ncomputational cost.\n2- Adopting CNN-based models for defect classification in PV cells by\nutilizing DNN transfer-based learning. Here, two interesting DNN\nmodels were elaborated and assessed (GoogleNet and SqueezeNet).\nThe deployed transfer-based GoogleNet and SqueezeNet have shown\nhigh performance in detecting and classifying PV faults in EL images\nwith a privilege granted to SqueezeNet in terms of the required\ncomputational efficiency.\n3- Implementing appropriate augmentation of the available ELPV\ndataset followed by accurate sample labeling along with proper\ncategorization of the samples in the ELPV dataset into proper classes.\nFig. 8. (continued).\nH. Munawer Al-Otum\nSolar Energy 278 (2024) 112803\n11\nThese procedures led to reach high classification performance\nincluding the accuracy, the precision, recall and F1-score.\nFinally, it would be worthy to note that the obtained results can be\nextended to other datasets of EL images and to possibly include other EL\nimages’ anomalies. Furthermore, it could be valuable to extend the\nresearch results to other issues like thermographic fault diagnosis in\ncommutators and induction motors. This can be tackled in forthcoming\npapers.\n5. Conclusions\nThe escalation of implementing the deep learning approaches in\nvarious aspects of our modern life has paved the way to novel disruptive\napplications. An increasing growth in the utilization of CNN-based\nneural networks has been witnessed in the field of PV fault detection\nand classification. In this work, an efficient defect detection and classi-\nfication approach, of EL images in PV cells, is developed based on using\nmulti-scale CNN models. Here, two approaches were deployed, the\nformer is based on deploying the pretrained SqueezeNet and the Goo-\ngleNet in a transfer learning fashion, whereas the latter is a light-weight\nCNN approach (denoted as LwNet). The deployed LwNet, SqueezeNet\nand Google Net have various number of layers (26, 68 and 144,\nrespectively). The experiments were elaborated on the ELPV dataset\nafter being properly modified and categized. Two scenarios were\nadopted, the former, using a 4-class classification procedure, while the\nlatter by utilizing an 8-class classification procedure. Experimental\nvalidation of the prescribed DNNs has demonstrated very promising\nperformance, especially when adopting the 8-class approach (which was\nnot tested before).

Numerous studies have been\nconducted to detect and monitor solar panel faults in real-time. This research examines the deployment of\ndeep learning models for identifying these faults. In this research, we propose a novel deep learning model\ncombining the InceptionV3-Net with U-Net architecture.

Introduction\nThe global energy landscape has significantly transitioned toward\necologically friendly and sustainable power-producing systems. Solar\npower systems have emerged as a crucial contribution to this change\nprocess. In addition to providing economic and environmental ad-\nvantages, solar panel devices can capture atmospheric sunlight and\ntransform it into electrical power. These factors include growing public\nawareness of environmental issues, the desire for energy independence,\nincentives for economic expansion, and the scalability inherent in solar\ntechnology. In today’s energy industry, multiple factors contribute to\nthe growth of solar power installations (Li et al., 2024). It is becoming\nmore common for developed and developing countries to deploy sub-\nstantial solar power systems (Li et al., 2023). When it comes to boosting\nenergy production, lowering operating costs, and ensuring the long-\nterm sustainability of these advancements, the proper management\nand maintenance of solar panels inside these power plants is very\nnecessary. It is hard to emphasize the importance of having effective\nmonitoring and cleaning methods for solar energy systems. Solar power\nplants have attracted a lot of attention during this wave of transfor-\nmation, regardless of whether they are located in developed countries\n∗Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: rifat.rudro@aiub.edu (R.A.M.

With the capacity to meet the\nelectricity requirements of enormous populations, these enormous solar\nplants are well-positioned to play a crucial role in the future of energy\ngeneration.\nThe efficient operation and maintenance of solar panels inside these\npower plants are essential to maximizing energy production, reducing\ncosts, and ensuring the long-term viability of these plants (Hu et al.,\n2016). Many causes, including dust buildup, snow cover, bird drop-\npings, and electrical abnormalities on the surfaces of solar panels in\nFig. 1, are responsible for energy losses. These losses highlight the\neffectiveness of monitoring and cleaning operations in solar power\nsystems. This paper aims to find the utilization of deep learning model\nclassifiers. Using Deep learning model classifiers can help optimize\nmaintenance efforts and minimize energy losses by correctly finding\nand categorizing surface defects on solar panels in Fig. 2 (Ramaneti\net al., 2021). This research can potentially increase the efficiency and\nstability of solar power systems. In recent years, research has focused on\nsolar panel power plants, specifically in the areas of fault detection and\npower generation. Despite the clear advantages of photovoltaic (PV)\nsystems, several challenges remain in maintaining the optimal perfor-\nmance of solar panels. Previous research has shown that existing deep\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2024.07.044\nReceived 11 February 2024; Received in revised form 20 June 2024; Accepted 22 July 2024\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 1580–1594\n1581\nR.A.M.

Fault Finding in Solar Panel — Fault 1 shows shattered glass and cell damage, Fault 2 indicates a burnt area in the center of cells, and Fault 3 highlights a fractured\ncell.\nlearning models for fault detection often struggle to accurately identify\nless common faults due to imbalanced datasets. Additionally, real-\ntime conditions factors have limited previous research models. Despite\nsignificant progress in utilizing deep learning for solar panel fault de-\ntection, several research gaps have been identified. These gaps include\nissues with data quality and imbalance, adaptability to real-world set-\ntings, interpretability of results, coverage of fault types, implementation\ncomplexity and cost, handling data noise and complexity, achieving\nmodel precision, and generalization.\nIn the past several years, a significant worldwide movement in\nthe energy sector has promoted using environmentally friendly and\nsustainable power-generating sources, including solar power (Sharma\nand Sharma, 2017). These systems convert the sun’s plentiful energy\ninto electrical energy, giving several environmental and economic ben-\nefits (Khan et al., 2023). The existing deep learning models for fault\ndetection in solar panels often fail to accurately identify less common\nfaults due to imbalanced datasets. Additionally, current models do not\nperform well under real-world conditions such as varying lighting,\nweather, and physical obstructions. Our research addresses these is-\nsues by developing the InceptionV3-Net with U-Net Architecture. The\nproposed model enhances fault detection accuracy and efficiency, even\nunder diverse conditions.\nThe proposed model’s novelty lies in its efficient design, with\nthe InceptionV3 base with ImageNet weights, convolutional layers,\nSqueeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, residual connections, and global\naverage pooling. Additionally, the model includes two dense layers\nwith LeakyReLU and batch normalization, culminating in a Soft-Max\noutput layer. This combination of architectural elements enables the\nmodel to effectively capture features at various scales and identify\nfaults in solar panels.\nThe research objective is broad and includes numerous significant\npoints:\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 1580–1594\n1582\nR.A.M. Rudro et al.\n• Panel Fault Detection: To establish a system that can identify\nvarious impurities, such as dust, snow, bird droppings, physical\ndamage, and electrical issues, that frequently harm solar panel\nsurfaces.\n• Improvement of precision: To achieve high precision while\nidentifying impurities. Select classifiers will require optimization\nand fine-tuning, and feature engineering and selection techniques\nwill require research to improve their performance to verify the\nsystem.\n• Efficiency Improvement: Enhance the tracking system’s effi-\nciency by accurately identifying the need for cleaning or repairs,\nthereby boosting energy production efficiency.\n• Cost Reduction: Reduce maintenance costs through efficient\nmonitoring and cleaning strategies, minimizing manual inspec-\ntions and repairs.\n• Resource Conservation: Align with sustainability goals by min-\nimizing resource use in solar panel maintenance, cleaning, and\nrepair only when necessary.\nThe current energy sector presents an excellent opportunity for\nthe development of solar power plants (Snegirev et al., 2017). Both\ndeveloped and developing countries are swiftly adopting extensive\nsolar power installations. Efficiently managing and maintaining solar\npanels in power plants is crucial for optimizing energy production,\nminimizing operational expenses, and guaranteeing the enduring via-\nbility of these developments (Duranay, 2023). The presence of dust,\nsnow, bird droppings, and other physical and electrical problems on\nthe surfaces of the solar panels may lead to energy losses (Ou-Yang and\nRen, 2009). The need for efficient monitoring and cleansing protocols\nin solar energy systems cannot be emphasized enough (García et al.,\n2022). Based on that purpose, we have selected research subjects to\nenhance the image processing and classification tasks related to various\ntypes of damage to solar panels.\nThe subsequent sections of the paper are structured in the following\nmanner: Section 2 provides the preceding related works. With numer-\nous figures and facts, Section 3 provides a thorough description of the\nmethodology. The proposed model is explained in Section 4 with some\nfigures and equations, while Section 5 provides a brief description of\nthe evaluation matrix. The proposed model outcome is discussed in\nSection 6, while Section 9 serves as the paper’s conclusion.\n2. Related works\nDeep learning has been used to detect solar faults, emphasiz-\ning choosing and training deep learning architectures to distinguish\nbetween working and damaged solar panels. Previously, several re-\nsearchers used deep learning for solar fault recognition. Selecting a\ndeep learning architecture and training the model to transform between\nworking solar panels and those emphasizing not. They overcame a lot\nof problems, such as getting different types of well-labeled data, fixing\nproblems with data imbalance (Alsafasfeh et al., 2018a), making sure\nthe model could be used for new types of faults, dealing with higher\ncomputational needs, and fixing issues with the model’s ability to work\nwith other models (Anon, 2021), on the detection of faults in solar\npanels. This involved finding the issues of collecting different data\ntypes, implementing remote monitoring systems, and utilizing machine\nlearning to diagnose problems (Dhanraj et al., 2021). They also employ\nsensors to detect errors quickly. Some challenges they face include\nensuring data quality, spotting errors, avoiding false positives and\nnegatives, managing implementation costs, and extrapolating across\ndifferent scenarios (Bemposta Rosende et al., 2020). These intricacies\ndraw attention to the challenges faced by complex solar panel fault\ndetection systems using these models.\nTo detect anomalies in PV panels, the study applies extreme gra-\ndient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting (LGBM), and cate-\ngorical boosting (CatBoost) using real-time temperature and irradiance\ndata (Adhya et al., 2022). LGBM did better than the other models, with\na 99.996% precision with class balancing issues. The study encountered\nseveral difficulties, including possible problems with the quality of the\ndata, limited coverage of fault types, concerns about generalizing the\nresults, implementation complexity, limitations on specific sensors and\nhardware, difficulties interpreting the algorithms, and a lack of false\npositive (Pamungkas et al., 2023) and negative analysis. Developed\nmethods for diagnosing PV array problems. The research article focuses\non creating and evaluating classifiers based on deep learning algorithms\nto automatically identify and diagnose typical issues in photovoltaic\narrays. They employed a variety of deep learning and machine learning\nmodels, including ImageNet, support vector machines, decision trees,\nand KNN, by using historical data (Badr et al., 2021).\nPV array power production is developed and executed by innova-\ntive methods to enhance the reliability and efficiency of photovoltaic\nsystems, with a particular focus on problem identification and diag-\nnosis (Rao et al., 2019). Using the K-means approach, they achieved\n99.72% model precision with data noise in their research, which has\nboth complex data handling and implementation processes.\nA convolutional neural network (CNN) and a fine-tuned visual\ngeometry group (VGG-16) model to examine thermal images with\nless complexity for detection in their research (Kellil et al., 2023).\nWhen using class-balanced distributions and small-DCNN pre-trained\nmodels, the research achieved a precision of 99.91% for identification\nand 99.80% for recognizing five distinct types of error classifications.\nUsing deep learning techniques to enhance issue diagnosis and main-\ntenance, Naveen Venkatesh and Sugumaran (2021) has significantly\nimproved defect identification in renewable energy. By utilizing critical\nfeatures extracted from aerial images captured by UAVs and deep\nlearning methods like CNNs and a pre-trained VGG16 network, they\ncan classify several fault categories, such as burn marks, delamination,\ndiscoloration, glass breakage, good panel, and snail trail.\nBy using statistical hypothesis testing with machine learning, pre-\ncisely Gaussian process regression (GPR), using a generalized likelihood\nratio test (GLRT) chart (Fazai et al., 2019). They were validated using\nnatural and simulated PV data, focusing on power, voltage, and current,\nwhich are three critical attributes of the system. An RMVDM can\nefficiently identify and localize using defects such as dust, micro-cracks,\nand spotlights. The model employs a multi-variant deep learning archi-\ntecture to train and detect errors (Sridharan and Sugumaran, 2021).\nBefore training, the image data is preprocessed using the Region-Based\nHistogram Approximation (RHA) method, and features are extracted\nusing the Gray Scale Quantization Technique (GSQA) (Henry et al.,\n2020). The research article employs the higher-order texture localiza-\ntion (HOTL) technique and both defect class support (DCS) values to\ntrain and recognize faults precisely throughout the testing process.\nThermal image and deep learning for detecting environmental faults\nin solar panels. They modified Squeeze-Net as the best-pretrained CNN\nmodel by implementing trial and error. Using thermal images as train-\ning data. This algorithm can identify environmental problems. The\nresults show that Squeeze-Net can find and classify issues with solar\npanels with better data quality and less data description, with a testing\nprecision of 99.74% and an F1 score of 0.9818.\n3. Methodology\nThe step by step procedure of the proposed framework is described\nin the following subsections and the framework architecture is depicted\nin Fig. 3.\n3.1. Proposed framework\nThe objective of solar panel fault detection is to complete the meth-\nods in four stages. In the first stage, we focus on image collection. In\nthis phase, we use advanced data preprocessing techniques to improve\nthe data quality. We have collected high-resolution images of solar\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 1580–1594\n1583\nR.A.M.

The second phase is solar panel segmentation, using image\nprocessing U-Net algorithms to create masking. The next step is to\nbuild a comprehensive system for error categorization by identifying\nand categorizing issues using deep learning models. Based on the model\nresults, we have analyzed the impact of power consumption.\n3.2. Solar panel dataset\nWe have chosen and assessed two public-access datasets to verify\nthe research approach. Table 1 indicates the number of images in\ntwo distinct datasets: Segmentation Data and Classification Data. The\nimages were split in a 60%-20%–20% ratio for training, validation, and\ntesting, respectively, shown in Table 2. The Segmentation Data dataset\nincludes 4616 images, with 2769 for training, 923 for validation, and\n924 for testing. Conversely, the Classification Data dataset comprises\n885 images, with 531 for training, 177 for validation, and 177 for test-\ning. A vast array of photovoltaic (PV) samples from sources, including\nsatellite and aerial photography (Fig. 4), make up the first dataset for\nthe proposed framework (Hou et al., 2021).1\n1 https://zenodo.org/records/5171712\nTable 3\nDistribution of images in different classes for training, validation, and testing in\nclassification.\nClass name\nTrain\nValidation\nTest\nTotal image\nPhysical-Damage\n41\n14\n14\n69\nElectrical-damage\n61\n20\n21\n102\nSnow-Covered\n71\n24\n24\n119\nClean\n115\n38\n39\n192\nDusty\n113\n38\n37\n188\nBird-drop\n129\n43\n43\n215\nTotal\n531\n177\n177\n885\nThe segmentation dataset contains six categories: ground cropland,\ngrassland, saline-alkali, shrubwood, water-surface, and rooftop. These\ncategories collectively represent the image distribution across different\nclasses, as shown in Fig. 5.\nThe second dataset is required to examine how well various deep-\nlearning image classifiers can recognize the surface conditions of solar\npanels. The dataset comprises six distinct categories: clean, dusty, bird\ndrop, electrical damage, physical damage, and snow-covered. These\ncategories collectively represent a spectrum of surface conditions fre-\nquently encountered in solar panel installations, as visually depicted\nin Fig. 6. These categories exhibit an inherent imbalance in their\ndistribution within the dataset. These data sources validate the U-\nNet model architecture’s image processing capacity and implement the\nproposed deep learning model. This evaluation process determines how\naccurate the U-Net model and proposed InceptionV3-Net for correctly\nfinding and classifying anomalies in different surface conditions on\nsolar panels (Chen et al., 2023).\nThe Table 3 presents a breakdown of the images distributed among\nsix distinct classes for a classification task. A 60:20:20, where the\nratio divided in train:validation: test split is employed, resulting in 531\nimages for the training dataset, with varying training images for each\nclass. By allocating images for training, validation, and testing, it is\npossible to evaluate the performance of the classification model.\n3.3. Data pre-processing and augmentation\nIn the initial image processing stage, the images are cropped to\ndimensions of 256 × 256 pixels. The values are normalized by being\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 1580–1594\n1584\nR.A.M. Rudro et al.\nFig. 4.

During data augmentation, there is\na 50% chance that input pictures and masks will be randomly inverted\nhorizontally. The first dataset is then divided into training, valida-\ntion, and testing sets, with a batch size of 24 sets used for training.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 1580–1594\n1585\nR.A.M. Rudro et al.\nFig. 6. The distribution of solar panel dataset categories in 6 classes — bird droppings, cleanliness, dust accumulation, electrical damage, physical damage, and snow coverage.\nOptimization involves prefetching data. This complete methodology\nguarantees that the data is suitably prepared for model training by en-\nsuring uniform picture sizes and pixel normalization, enhancing model\nperformance. Furthermore, the dataset is improved by applying random\nrotations to the pictures and masks, augmenting the variability in the\ntraining data. This facilitates the model’s ability to extrapolate more\neffectively to diverse orientations and angles (Mujtaba and ArifWani,\n2021). Additionally, the photographs undergo random cropping and\nresizing at various sizes, imitating diverse views and viewpoints. This\naugmentation strategy enhances the model’s ability to handle item size\nand location fluctuations within the photos, making it more robust (Wu\net al., 2022).\n4. Proposed models\nWe can find the solar panel using the U-Net model architecture\nfor satellite image segmentation. This section introduces a proposed\ndeep-learning model architecture for finding the panel faults.\n4.1. Deep learning models\nDeep learning models like U-Net, Dense-Net, MobileNetV3, VGG19,\nCNN, VGG16, Resnet50, InceptionV3, and a proposed InceptionV3-\nNet models are utilized for solar panel fault detection due to their\nadvanced capabilities in automatically detecting and segmenting fea-\ntures in imagery. These models enhance the precision and efficiency of\nfault identification tasks, such as finding panel abnormal issues. Imple-\nmenting base models enables scalable and automated surveillance of\nextensive solar farms, ensuring reliable operation even amidst diverse\nenvironmental conditions (Karagoz et al., 2022). Including various\narchitectures allows for a comprehensive improvement of the fault\ndetection process in solar panels.\n4.2. U-Net model architecture\nU-Net architecture is utilized to conclude the image segmentation\nprocess of solar panel (Slonimer et al., 2022; Gonthina et al., 2024).\nThe U-Net architecture completes the segmentation operation in stage\nfour.\nTable 4\nEncoder feature layers in the U-net model.\nLayer name\nResolution\nBlock 1 Relu\n64 x 64\nBlock 3 Relu\n32 x 32\nBlock 6 Relu\n16 x 16\nBlock 13 Relu\n8 x 8\nBlock 16 Project\n4 x 4\nTable 5\nUp-sampling blocks in the U-net decoder.\nUp-sampling resolution\nNumber\nof filters\n4 × 4 to 8 × 8\n512\n8 × 8 to 16 × 16\n256\n16 × 16 to 32 × 32\n128\n32 × 32 to 64 × 64\n64\nStage 1 Encoder (Down-sampler): The encoder begins with a pre-\ntrained MobileNetV2 model with input shape 256 × 256 × 3 and the\ntop classification layers. For feature extraction, certain layers from the\nMobileNetV2 model are chosen (Li et al., 2022; Li and Chen, 2024).\nThese layers are selected to collect characteristics at various spatial\nresolutions in Table 4\nStage 2 Decoder (Up-sampler): The up-sample function defines\na set of up-sampling blocks that are used in the construction of\nthe decoder. Each block starts with a transposed convolution layer\n(Conv2DTranspose) and then optionally adds dropout, batch normaliza-\ntion, and ReLU activation. U-Net architecture does the job of selecting\nimages of solar panels. The u-net design finishes the segmentation\nprocess at layer four. These up-sampling blocks are part of the up-stack\nlist, which makes the feature maps gradually larger in Table 5.\nStage 3 Combining Encoder and Decoder: Up-sampling is inte-\ngrated with skip connections. Each up-sampling block combines the\nfeature maps from the encoder (down stack) with the up-sampled\nfeature maps. The inclusion of this skip link aids in the preservation of\nintricate information. The decoder incrementally enhances the spatial\nresolution until it attains the target output dimensions of 128 × 128\npixels.\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 1580–1594\n1586\nR.A.M. Rudro et al.\nFig. 7. Aerial images of solar panels with corresponding true mask annotations for fault detection.\nStage 4 Output layer: The final layer of the model consists of\na Conv2DTranspose layer that converts the feature maps into the\nrequired output shape (128 × 128 × 1) using a sigmoid activation\nfunction (Wang and Xiao, 2023). This activation function generates\nbinary predictions for each pixel. Fig. 8 represents the U-Net model\narchitecture, which is structured in a flowchart format. The model\nconsists of various layers that are sequentially connected, with some\nlayers being concatenated with others.\nThe layers are labeled with Input-Layer, Sequential, and Concate-\nnate, followed by numbers that potentially correspond to their order or\nlevel in the model. Each layer box also displays the shape of the input\nand output data, with dimensions specified in tuples that indicate the\nsize of the tensors as they pass through the network. At the bottom of\nFig. 8 is a layer labeled conv2d transpose 4: Conv2DTranspose, which\nindicates a transposed convolutional layer. This layer is used for image\nsegmentation and generative models, where the spatial dimensions of\nthe input are increased. By visually representing the flow and structure\nof the model, the diagram illustrates how data is transformed and\ncombined as it moves through the network.\n4.3. InceptionV3-Net\nThe range of applications and robust feature extraction capabilities\nof the InceptionV3 architecture make it highly suitable for identifying\nproblems in solar panels through image analysis (Chavan and Pete,\n2023a). Setting up the design is the first step in creating a model for\nfinding faults in solar panels.\nIt loads the InceptionV3 base model with ImageNet weights and\nsets the number of fault types in Fig. 9–10. We add convolutional\nlayers with LeakyReLU activation to avoid dying ReLu issues, 256\nfilters, a kernel size of (3, 3), and the same padding. It uses a sigmoid\nactivation function to set up 64 units in the first dense layer and\n128 units in the second dense layer for Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)\nBlocks (Salekin et al., 2019). Thoughtfully placed residual connections\nimprove gradient flow. Added global average pooling layer brings\ntogether spatial data in the best way possible. Two dense layers, one\nwith 1024 units and the other with 512 units, comprise the fully\nconnected layers. The first dense layer has LeakyReLU activation, batch\nnormalization, and a dropout rate of 0.5. Lastly, the output layer uses a\nthick layer with soft-max activation for classification.

Evaluation metrics\nIn assessing the performance of a fault detection model, particularly\nin applications such as solar panel fault detection, the careful selection\nof suitable metrics is of utmost importance. In this regard, precision\nin Eq. (5), recall in Eq. (6), and the F1 score (the harmonic mean of\nprecision and recall) in Eq. (7) are remarkably appropriate metrics (Yan\net al., 2022; Khan and Ali Rana, 2019). By employing precision, the\nmodel effectively detects genuine defects while reducing the occurrence\nof false alarms. The recall identifies many genuine defects as feasible.\nWith context to solar panels, a high recall indicates that the model\ncan accurately detect a diverse array of faults. F1 Score objectively\nevaluates the model’s performance by considering precision and recall.\nThe Intersection over Union (IoU) in Eq. (8) is used in the analysis\nof satellite images for evaluating the precision of solar panel segmenta-\ntion (Goyzueta et al., 2021). It measures the degree of overlap between\nthe projected segmentation of solar panels and the ground-truth por-\ntions of solar panels in the image. In addition, the Dice coefficient\nmeasures the accuracy of segmentation models by quantifying the\nsimilarity between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth. In\nthe context of solar panel image segmentation, it calculates the overlap\nbetween the model’s prediction and actual solar panel boundaries, with\na score of 1 indicating perfect agreement and 0 meaning no overlap.\nIn Eq. (9), X represents the pixels in the predicted segmentation, and\nY defines the pixels in the ground truth segmentation (Stephanie and\nSarno, 2018).\n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=\n𝑇𝑃\n𝑇𝑃+ 𝐹𝑃\n𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒, 𝑇𝑃= 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒, 𝐹𝑃= 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒\n(5)\n𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙=\n𝑇𝑃\n𝑇𝑃+ 𝐹𝑁\n𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒, 𝑇𝑃= 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒, 𝐹𝑁= 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒\n(6)\n𝐹1 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒= 2 × 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛× 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙\n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+ 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙\n(7)\n𝐼𝑜𝑈= 𝐴𝑜\n𝐴𝑢\n𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒, 𝐼𝑜𝑈= 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑛, 𝐴𝑜= 𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑜𝑓𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝,\n𝑎𝑛𝑑𝐴𝑢= 𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑜𝑓𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑛\n(8)\n𝐷= 2|𝑋∩𝑌|\n|𝑋| + |𝑌|\n𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒, 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑒𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐶𝑜𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡, |𝑋∩𝑌| 𝑖𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛, |𝑋|𝑎𝑛𝑑|𝑌|\n𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠.\n(9)\n6.

U-Net model performance\nThe performance of a deep learning model over 8 training epochs\nshows consistent improvement in both training and validation phases\nin Tables 6 and 7.\nTraining loss decreased from 0.4520 to 0.1616, indicating effective\nlearning and error reduction. The Training Dice Coefficient, measuring\nprecision in segmentation tasks in Fig. 11, increased from 0.5480 to\n0.8387, demonstrating enhanced predictive precision. Training Binary\nprecision remained high and stable, suggesting consistent performance\nin binary classification. Similarly, model training loss decreased over\ntime, signaling good generalization to segmented data.\nThe validation Dice Coefficient’s upward trend, from 0.8108 to\n0.8341, and high validation binary precision (starting at 0.9347 and\nreaching 0.9563) further underscores the model’s strong generalization\nability. These metrics collectively indicate a successful validation pro-\ncess, with the model showing decreased loss and improved precision in\nsegmentation and binary classification tasks.\nThe IoU score is initially low, but there is a significant increase to\n0.4423, and it continues to improve, reaching a high of 0.7631. That\nremains the same at 0.7631 in the later epochs, shown in Fig. 12, which\nindicates that the segmentation and prediction of satellite images are\nworking correctly.\nA threshold value was used to evaluate the probability estimates\nprovided by the U-Net segmentation model.

It extracts the image and true mask (ground truth) for\neach image, computes the model’s probability prediction, and creates\na binary mask using the threshold.\n7. Classification model outcome\nThis section provides a comprehensive overview of the performance\nof the deep learning models implemented during the training and\nvalidation phases. The evaluation metrics of F1 scores, Recall, and\nPrecision have been carefully calculated on the training and testing\ndata sources to ascertain the model’s effectiveness. The details of the\ntraining and testing performances are described below.\n7.1. Model training performance\nThe analysis of the training accuracies of the various deep learning\nmodels shows that each model expresses varying degrees of effec-\ntiveness in learning from its training dataset, as shown in Table 8.\nDense-Net, with a training accuracy of only 21.28%, appears to have\nsignificant under-fitting, which indicates a failure to capture the under-\nlying patterns in the solar panel faults data. Conversely, MobileNetV3\nand VGG19 display moderate to good learning levels with an accu-\nracy of around 70%–77%, indicating proper data performance without\nover-fitting. The CNN and VGG16 models are balanced around 80%\naccuracy, presenting a high level of learning but approaching the\nthreshold where over-fitting might be a concern. Resnet50 reflects\nthis trend as well. On the other hand, InceptionV3 and the proposed\nInceptionV3-Net stand out with exceptionally high training accuracies\nof over 90%, indicating effective learning. The proposed InceptionV3-\nNet model has achieved a high training accuracy of 99.01%. This\nraises concerns about over-fitting, as the models might have tailored\nthemselves too closely to the training data. Potentially compromising\ntheir ability to generalize to new, unseen data. It is essential to bal-\nance effective learning with the ability to generalize, particularly in\nmodels that express incredibly high training accuracies. In comparing\nthe training and validation datasets where all models perform well on\nthe training data, their performance often drops when applied to the\nvalidation dataset. This suggests that the models are overfitting as they\nstruggle to generalize their learning to unseen data. In the validation\nanalysis, it was observed that all the models demonstrated varying\nperformance levels. Among all the models, the proposed InceptionV3-\nNet has an exceptional F1 score of 0.99 and an impressive validation\naccuracy of around 98.34%.\nThe range of precision values lies between 0.20 to 0.99. InceptionV3-\nNet (proposed) exhibits the highest precision score of 0.99, while\nDense-Net shows the lowest precision at 0.20. Across the models, recall\nvalues span from 0.20 to 0.98.

Model testing performance\nThe test accuracies of the models exhibit varying abilities to gen-\neralize to new, unseen data. This indicates a model’s real-world per-\nformance, reflecting how well the model can apply the knowledge it\nhas gained to new situations and scenarios. The model with the lowest\ntest accuracy is Dense-Net, with a score of 21.00% in Table 9. This\nsuggests that there is a significant need for improvement in terms\nof generalization. MobileNetV3 performs moderately well with a test\naccuracy of 70.04%, indicating that it can handle new data reasonably\nwell.\nVGG19 shows a better ability to learn, with a test accuracy of\n77.00%, suggesting that it has learned patterns widely applicable be-\nyond the training set. The CNN model displays an excellent ability\nto adapt to new data, with a test accuracy of 79.40%. VGG16’s test\naccuracy of 80.00% is commendable, indicating that it learns well\nand effectively applies these leanings to novel scenarios. A modified\nversion of the VGG16 model achieved a test accuracy of 80.05% by\nadding dense layers of different unit sizes (1024, 512, 256, and 128)\nand using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation algorithm. After\neach layer, a dropout layer with a specific dropout rate (0.5, 0.4, 0.3,\nand 0.2) was added. In comparison, the base model of VGG16 and the\nmodified VGG16 model showed slight improvements. Resnet50, with a\ntest accuracy of 80.79%, slightly surpasses VGG16, indicating a slightly\nbetter ability to apply its knowledge to unseen data. Fig. 14 visually\nrepresents the confusion matrix of InceptionV3-Net performance across\nsix classes. The high diagonal values indicate correct classifications\nand the matrix suggests a strong predictive ability, with certain classes\nshowing higher instances of accurate predictions.\nThe most imposing models are InceptionV3 and the proposed\nInceptionV3-Net, with test accuracies of 90.19% and 94.35%, respec-\ntively. These high scores indicate exceptional adaptability, demon-\nstrating that these models can recognize complex patterns and apply\nthem effectively to new situations. This is particularly noteworthy\nfor InceptionV3-Net, which balances a high learning capability with\nexcellent adaptability, as reflected in its performance. In the context\nof F1 scores, the analysis reveals that Dense-Net displays the lowest F1\nScore of 0.19, while MobileNetV3, VGG19, CNN, VGG16, and Resnet50\nexhibit moderate performance. When comparing the precision and\nrecall abilities of the tested models, InceptionV3 and InceptionV3-Net\n(Proposed) stand out as they demonstrate high precision scores of 0.92\nand 0.94, respectively.\n7.3. Discussion\nThe U-Net model has shown significant improvement in solar plant\nsatellite image segmentation. The metrics indicate reduced training loss\nand increased training and testing Dice Coefficient, binary precision,\nand intersection over union (IoU) scores. These observations suggest\nthat the U-Net model is highly efficient and accurate in segmenting\nsolar plant images, making it a reliable and effective tool for precise\nimage segmentation tasks.\nIn the context of solar panel fault detection, the performance of the\nmodels varies significantly, as indicated by their F1 Score, precision,\nand recall. Dense-Net is a notable under-performer, reflected in its\nlow F1 Score of 0.19, Precision of 0.21, and Recall of 0.19, aligning\nwith its poor training, validation, and test accuracies of around 21%.\nThis suggests substantial difficulties in learning and generalizing. In\ncontrast, MobileNetV3 exhibits a moderate performance level with\nbalanced metrics: an F1 Score of 0.66 and both precision and recall at\n0.66. It corresponds to its closely aligned training, validation, and test\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 1580–1594\n1592\nR.A.M. Rudro et al.\nFig. 15. Proposed InceptionV3-Net model predictions on solar panel cleanliness, showcasing high accuracy in distinguishing between clean and dusty panels.\naccuracies of around 70%, indicating a well-balanced model without\nsevere over-fitting or under-fitting.\nOn the other hand, VGG19 and CNN models demonstrate more\nrobust performance. VGG19 has an F1 score of 0.79, precision of 0.76,\nand recall of 0.78, while CNN shows an F1 Score of 0.75, precision\nof 0.77, and recall of 0.75. Both models exhibit slightly higher test\naccuracies than their training accuracies, suggesting practical tuning\nand strong generalization capabilities. VGG16 and Resnet50 also per-\nform well, with VGG16 recording an F1 score of 0.79, precision of\n0.87, and recall of 0.80, and Resnet50 showing consistently high values\nwith an F1 Score, precision, and recall all at 0.81. These metrics\nindicate reliable and precise fault detection abilities. The InceptionV3\nand proposed InceptionV3-Net models stand out with their exceptional\nperformance in InceptionV3 with an F1 score of 0.91, precision of\n0.92, and recall of 0.90, and InceptionV3-Net with all metrics at 0.94.\nDespite a slight drop in test accuracies, these high values underscore\ntheir exceptional precision and recall in fault detection, making them\nhighly suitable for practical solar panel fault detection applications.\nFrom the previous background studies, the effectiveness of deep\nlearning models in fault detection and segmentation tasks. Recent stud-\nies highlight the significant improvement in performance metrics such\nas Dice Coefficient and IoU scores when using advanced segmentation\nmodels such as U-Net. For instance, Adhya et al. (2022) demonstrated\nthat selective machine learning techniques could enhance PV array\nfault diagnosis, improving the robustness and reliability of the detection\nsystems. This aligns with our findings of U-Net’s efficiency and accu-\nracy in segmenting solar plant images. Additionally, Pamungkas et al.\n(2023) have shown that architectures similar to ResNet and VGG are\nrobust in handling diverse classification tasks under varying conditions.\nThe observations of VGG19 and Resnet50’s strong generalization ca-\npabilities and reliable performance metrics. These models consistently\nexhibit high F1 scores, precision, and recall, reinforcing their suitability\nfor precise fault detection tasks. In terms of InceptionV3 architecture,\nLi and Chen (2024) validate the high performance of this model in\nimage recognition tasks. Their work supports the exceptional results of\nour proposed InceptionV3-Net model, which achieved high accuracy,\nprecision, and recall in practical solar panel fault detection scenarios.\nThe precise identification and categorization of faults is facili-\ntated by the proposed InceptionV3-Net model. Fig. 15 presents the\nmodel’s predictions on the cleanliness of solar panels, distinguishing\nbetween clean and dusty panels with high accuracy with validates the\nInceptionV3-Net model in real-world scenarios. It enables targeted and\nefficient corrective actions by minimizing downtime and maximizing\nthe performance of solar panels. The fault detection systems ensure that\nspecific issues impacting power generation, such as shading, module\ndegradation, or electrical failures, can be promptly addressed. As a\nresult, the enhanced accuracy of this model positively contributes to im-\nproving operational efficiency, increasing energy yield, and extending\nthe lifespan of solar installations.\n8. Comparative analysis\nThe findings of this study demonstrate that the proposed InceptionV3-\nNet model achieves superior accuracy in solar panel fault detection.\nUnlike previous models by Adhya et al. (2022) and Pamungkas et al.\n(2023), which lack advanced segmentation and hybrid modeling ca-\npabilities, the InceptionV3-Net effectively integrates these techniques,\nsignificantly enhancing fault detection accuracy. Additionally, it ad-\ndresses the computational efficiency issues noted in Li and Chen (2024)\nand fully leverages data augmentation to improve robustness and\nreduce overfitting, as highlighted by Wu et al. (2022). In contrast to\nSlonimer et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2022), who focused on hybrid\nmodels and efficiency without comprehensive data augmentation, the\nInceptionV3-Net combines all these critical aspects. Rahman et al.\n(2021) emphasized hybrid models but lacked adequate segmenta-\ntion and augmentation which is shown in Table 10. By integrating\nthese essential components, the InceptionV3-Net not only improves\nEnergy Reports 12 (2024) 1580–1594\n1593\nR.A.M.

Conclusion\nIn this research, we present a novel InceptionV3-Net model, sig-\nnificantly improving solar panel fault detection. Initially, aerial satel-\nlite images are processed using the U-net model architecture with a\n256 × 256 × 3 input shape, undergoing three stages: decoding the\ninput, combining encoding and decoding, and generating the out-\nput. The InceptionV3-Net architecture employs the InceptionV3 base\nwith ImageNet weights, enhanced by convolutional layers, Squeeze-\nand-Excitation (SE) blocks, residual connections, and global average\npooling. The model includes two dense layers with LeakyReLU and\nbatch normalization, ending with a Soft-Max output layer. It also\nutilizes data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shift, shear,\nzoom, and brightness adjustments. The model is trained using the Adam\noptimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 and categorical cross-entropy\nloss. The InceptionV3-Net model expresses exceptional performance by\nachieving a validation accuracy of 98.34%, test accuracy of 94.35%,\nan F1 Score of 0.94, a precision of 0.94, and a recall of 0.94 outper-\nforming other researcher’s works. Future work could address several\nopen scopes to further improvement in the InceptionV3-Net model’s\ncapabilities. Applying the model to other renewable energy systems,\nsuch as wind turbines or hydroelectric plants, would test its versatility.\nFurther optimization of the model for real-time fault detection could be\noutlined as future work to improve its practical utility.\nFunding\nThis research is funded by the Researchers Supporting Project Num-\nber (RSPD2024R1027), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nRifat Al Mamun Rudro: Writing – original draft, Conceptualiza-\ntion.

With the recent advances in low-weight, high-precision, and fast- \nresponse thermal cameras, along with professional aerial platforms, aerial infrared thermography (aIRT) is \ncurrently the most popular method for non-destructive, fast, and relatively inexpensive monitoring of photo­\nvoltaic (PV) power plants. Typically, aerial inspections are conducted using a UAV (drone) equipped with a \nthermal camera to produce a report indicating detected thermal defects, typically associated with failures. The \nmain purpose of this paper was to compare the thermographic results for two different PV plants provided by two \nremote sensing-based approaches: the classical UAV-mounted thermal camera survey and the inspection by high- \nspeed thermal cameras mounted on an airplane. The post-processing of thermal patterns showed good agreement \nbetween the results provided by the two aerial platforms, with an overlap of thermal anomalies detected up to \n98%. An economic analysis demonstrated that, while airplane surveys incur higher costs (compared to UAV \nsurveys) due to the hire of vehicles and more expensive instrumentation, they, on the other hand, require a \nreduced amount of time and may be more convenient when inspecting large-scale PV plants or multiple PV plants \nlocated within a close area.   \nIntroduction \nSolar photovoltaic (PV) plants have been steadily increasing over the \nlast few decades, capturing the attention of governments and re­\nsearchers. Europe’s recent gas crisis and the surge in energy prices have \nfurther accelerated the installation of PV systems for both residential \nand commercial use. This necessitates continuous operation and main­\ntenance practices, including cleaning, fault detection, and prompt \nreplacement of malfunctioning components [1]. PV monitoring systems \naim to provide information on energy potential, energy extraction, \noperating temperature analysis for potential faults and the associated \nenergy loss [2]. \nIn the early stages, manual or visual inspection of PV modules was \ncommon for a broad overview to identify defective modules [3]. How­\never, this method, being complex and time-intensive, is impractical for \nlarge- or commercial-scale PV systems, which require a fast, reliable, \nand low-cost monitoring system. Electrical testing, such as cur­\nrent–voltage curve analysis, provides real-time performance monitoring \nbut fails to pinpoint defective modules [4]. Imaging inspections using \ntechniques like electroluminescence (EL) and infrared thermography \n(IRT) have overcome some drawbacks of visual and electrical moni­\ntoring techniquies and have been recognized as non-destructive tech­\nnologies since the 1990s [5]. Specifically, since the temperature is a \ncommon indicator of faulty and damaged elements, such faults can be \ndetected by analysing temperature distribution patterns captured by \nIRT. Although luminescence techniques can offer detailed information \nabout faults that are invisible to visual and IRT inspection, they have \ncertain drawbacks. These include the necessity to be performed in dark \nconditions, with the supply of external power and the interruption of the \nPV plant’s operation [4]. Additionally, they exhibit reduced flexibility, \nas compared to IRT imaging, to be implemented in aerial inspections \n[6]. \nIn summary, infrared thermography (IRT), through which real-time \ntemperature can be measured, has become a widely-utilized monitoring \ntechnique [7]; it is a non-destructive method, accurate, and relatively \ncheap thanks to the recent development of thermal infrared cameras. \nMoreover, it can operate without interrupting the energy production of \nPV plants. However, manual, ground-based IRT inspection is time- \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: giovanni.tanda@unige.it (G.

The efficiency of this method can \nbe significantly enhanced by mounting the sensor on aerial platforms, \nsuch as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling the monitoring of \nlarge areas of the PV plant in a relatively short time. This integration of \nIRT with aerial vehicles is termed aerial infrared thermography (aIRT) \nand is currently employed in various environmental monitoring appli­\ncations (e.g., refs. [8–11]). It stands out as one of the most popular \ndiagnostic tools for solar PV systems, as evidenced by numerous studies \nshowcasing its potential (see, for instance, review papers at refs. \n[3,7,12–14]). \nAs mentioned earlier, the thermal pattern monitored by IRT serves as \na useful indicator of the correct working condition of a PV module. \nHowever, results provided by a thermal camera can be influenced by \nvarious external factors, including environmental parameters (such as \nsolar lights, air temperature and humidity), radiant properties of mod­\nules (emissivity variations, reflections, etc.), characteristics of the IR \ndevice (malfunctions, miscalibrations, etc.), and the aerial survey con­\nditions (vision angle, shadowed areas). For these reasons, ideal condi­\ntions for aIRT include the proper orientation of UAV-mounted IRT \ndevices (perpendicular to the PV modules), a flight altitude not too low \n(to prevent UAV self-shading) and not too high (to avoid compromising \nspatial resolution), along with environmental conditions featuring a \ncloudless sky, low wind velocity, and adequate solar irradiance (more \nthan 600 W/m2 on the plane of the inspected PV module), as reported in \n[15]. Additionally, the instrumentation mounted on aerial platforms \nsignificantly impacts the quality of thermal images and photogram­\nmetric end products, which depend on many aspects of the thermo­\ngraphic camera, such as resolution, thermal sensitivity, accuracy, lens \nand the corresponding field-of-view (FOV), radiometric functionality, \nframe rate, temperature range. Furthermore, the maximum payload \nmust be compatible with UAV characteristics, without affecting the \nstability of the system and the duration of flight and batteries [16]. \nVisual inspection of the PV plant, complementing thermal imagery, is \nalso recommended. This is because the presence of soiling, bird drop­\npings, dust, etc., may be misinterpreted as a “false” hotspot, possibly \ndue, for instance, to local variations in emissivity induced by these \nexternal impurities rather than to a real overheating of the inspected \nsurface. The integration of a visible RGB camera onboard is typically \nconsidered to record both ambient conditions (shadowed areas of PV \npanels due to cloud coverage) and PV module conditions (degree of \nsoiling) [15]. \nThe typical outputs of each aIRT survey are orthophoto maps (in \nboth infrared and visual spectra) of the investigated PV plant, produced \nby software for photogrammetry data treatment. Assuming that proper \noperations for flight and camera settings are adhered to, the thermal \npattern facilitates the diagnosis of failures based on the fault classifi­\ncation reported in the international standard IEC TS 62446-3 [17]. \nThe use of aerial drones expedites the detection of faults within a \nlarge solar PV plant. However, if the IR camera is not fast (e.g., a com­\nmon IR uncooled camera with a bolometer detector), the drone’s moving \nspeed must be relatively low to avoid smearing effects on thermal im­\nages. This can adversely impact the flight duration needed to cover all \ninvestigation areas, leading to increased costs for personnel and overfly \napprovals. A potential alternative involves using light airplanes instead \nof drones. An airplane can cover a very large area in a shorter time, \nresulting in more cost-efficient flights, especially when inspecting large- \nscale PV plants or numerous PV plants located in close proximity. On the \nother hand, to achieve an acceptable ground resolution of thermal im­\nages and avoid smearing effects due to the carrier speed, the airplane- \nmounted IR camera requires high resolution and a higher number of \nacquired frames per second. These characteristics are typically found in \ncooled thermal cameras, which are much more expensive than standard \nuncooled cameras. \nThe objective of this research is to compare the fault detection an­\nalyses performed, for two different solar PV plants, using alternatively \nan unmanned drone and a manned aircraft as aerial platforms, equipped \nwith different IR cameras to provide reliable and comparable thermal \nimages over the same inspected sites. Within the knowledge of the au­\nthors, airplane-based aIRT inspections of PV power plants are not yet \ndocumented in the literature. Therefore, this research aims to make a \nvaluable contribution to the development of increasingly effective, fast, \nand reliable methods for defect detection in PV systems. The two distinct \naerial platforms, each fitted with a thermal camera capable of capturing \nsequences of images compatible with the carrier speed, were employed \nto inspect two solar PV plants. These plants, similar in size and located a \nshort distance from one another, were simultaneously inspected by both \nUAV and airplane to minimize the impact of environmental conditions \non thermal inspections. \nMaterials and methods \nThe inspected solar PV systems are installed at Bene Vagenna (lati­\ntude 44◦30′21.4″ N, longitude 7◦50′48.3″ E), referred to as System 1, and \nat Farigliano (latitude 44◦31′39.7″ N, longitude 7◦55′01.7″ E), referred to \nas System 2. System 1 consists of 4347 polycrystalline silicon PV mod­\nules, while System 2 consists of 4158 polycrystalline silicon PV modules. \nOrthophoto visual images of the two plants are shown in Fig. 1. Both \nsystems have an installed capacity of about 1 MW. The two systems are \nlocated in close proximity (about 6 km apart), allowing for the inspec­\ntion of both plants on the same day. \nFor each plant, two aerial platforms, shown in Fig. 2, were simulta­\nneously used. These platforms included a UAV, type DJI Mavic 2 En­\nterprise Advanced, and a manned airplane, type P2006T SMP. Two \nseparate inspections of the two PV systems were conducted on different \ndays and using distinct thermal cameras. The first inspection (I1) of both \nsystems was carried out on 5 April 2022, from 1:07 pm to 2:16 pm, \nunder the following environmental conditions: ambient air temperature \nof 8–9 ◦C, air relative humidity of 40–44 %, wind velocity (at ground) of \n6–8 km/h, and module-plane-irradiance of 1061–1067 W/m2, with a \nclear sky. The second inspection (I2) was carried out on 13 May 2022, \nfrom 1:45 pm to 2:53 pm, under the following environmental condi­\ntions: ambient air temperature of 21–22 ◦C, air relative humidity of \n63–64 %, wind velocity at ground level of 8 km/h, and module-plane- \nirradiance of 984–1035 W/m2, with a clear sky. \nDuring the first inspection, the UAV was equipped with a DJI M2EA \nthermal camera having an uncooled, 640 × 512 microbolometer de­\ntector, operating in the 8–14 μm wavelength range, while a FLIR A8580 \nFig. 1.

For \nthe second inspection, the airplane carried a thermal camera (model \nFLIR X8581 InSb, 1280 × 1024 cooled sensor) operating in a different \nwavelength range (3–5 μm), while the UAV used the same thermal \ncamera as in the first inspection. The rationale behind using a different \nthermal camera during the second airplane inspection was to permit the \ncomparison between thermal patterns obtained by two IR cameras with \ndifferent spectral responses, specifically the long infrared wavelength \nrange (LW) for the drone and the medium infrared wavelength range \n(MW) for the airplane. \nThe characteristics of aerial inspections and meteorological infor­\nmation are summarized in Table 1, while the specifications (according to \nmanufacturer) of the thermal detectors used in each inspection are \nprovided in Table 2, along with the terminology adopted throughout the \npaper. Furthermore, visual images were captured for all inspections \nusing a conventional digital RGB camera with 8000 × 6000 pixels \n(model DJI M2EA for UAV inspections and Sony ILCE-7RM4 for airplane \ninspections). It is worth noting that each survey lasted about 70 min, \ninclusive of time allocated for the UAV to inspect both PV plants and to \nbe transported from one site to the other; the plane flew simultaneously \nwith the UAV, taking a total of seven minutes to inspect both systems, \nplus additional time for travel to and from the airplane hangar. \nAs indicated in Table 1, for both surveys the drone and aircraft flights \nwere approximately at distances of 22 m and 300 m from the ground, \nrespectively. These altitudes corresponded to a ground sampling dis­\ntance of 3 cm/pixel and 7 cm/pixel, respectively. While the former \nresolution at ground level (for the UAV) aligns with standard recom­\nmendations for IR aerial inspection [17], the latter, relatively coarse, is \nthe best achievable resolution, compatible with the capabilities of the \ncooled IR sensor (the best commercially available at the time of survey) \nmounted on the aircraft and the mandated flight altitude of not less than \n300 m, as prescribed by current flight regulation requirements. \nRegarding the radiometric measurements, the emissivity was set to 0.85, \nwhich is the characteristic value of the glass cover of a PV module. \nThe thermal anomalies detected by aIRT inspection have been \ndivided into five categories, adapted from the international standard IEC \nTS 62446–3 [17] and outlined in Table 3: single (A) or multiple (B) \nhotspots inside a module, uniformly hot substring inside a module (C), \nuniformly hot module (D), and uniformly hot string (series of discon­\nnected modules, E). Single and multiple hotspots denote thermal \nanomalies concentrated within a limited area (a few pixels of thermal \nimages), appearing as isolated (A) or numerous (B) inside the inspected \nPV module. These anomalies correspond to cells or part of cells that are \ncracked or disconnected, and delamination points. Uniformly hot \nsubstrings (C) appear as a part of the PV module (typically one-third) \nhomogeneously heated up; these cells are disconnected, causing the \nbypass diode to carry the full current of the substring. The uniformly hot \nmodule (D) indicates an anomaly extending to the entire module, which \nis likely disconnected or has a broken front glass. Finally, a uniformly \nhot string (E) is a series of many heated-up modules that are likely in an \nopen circuit. \nFor each category, the degree of thermal abnormality was assessed \nbased on the temperature difference from the normal operating device, i. \ne., the temperature difference between the hotspot and the “healthy” \nmodule. Although no general consensus exists in the technical literature \nregarding the temperature difference thresholds that identify a thermal \nanomaly and its degree of severity, temperature difference ranges of 2–7 \nK, 7–10 K, and more than 10 K were assumed in this study, choices \nconsistent with recommendations reported in Annex C of ref. [17]. \nSpecifically, a temperature difference below 2 K was not considered a \nthermal anomaly, as it falls within the uncertainty of the measurement. \nThe anomaly was classified as mild, intermediate, or severe when the \ntemperature difference falls within 2–7 K, 7–10 K, or is larger than 10 K, \nrespectively. Fig. 3 provides illustrative examples of the most common \ncategories of thermal defects observed during the inspections. \nCollected visual and thermal images from aerial inspections were \nprocessed in the Agisoft Metashape software environment for photo­\ngrammetric restitution, specifically to generate one orthomosaic for \neach spectrum. The orthomosaics result from two different processes: (i) \nmosaicking, which merges images to produce a single, representative \nmap of the photovoltaic plant, and (ii) ortho-rectification, which corrects \nthe map for geometrical distortions and deformations due to perspective \nand camera lens. \nAdditionally, a point vector layer was generated based on the cen­\ntroids of the thermal images, representing the location where each \nimage was collected. Since the points are associated with the name of the \ncorresponding image, the integration of the vector layer, the visual \northomosaic, and the thermal orthomosaic, all georeferenced in the \nUTM (Universe Transverse Mercator) WGS84 32 N projected coordinate \nsystem and thus overlapped, facilitated the analysis process (Fig. 4). In \nthe GIS (Geographic Information System) software environment, \ndefective solar panels were manually located and identified thanks to \nvisual or thermal anomalies detected from one of the two orthomosaics \nor from their combined information. Hence, the name of the original \nthermal images where the unhealthy solar panels were captured was \neasily read from the closest capture points of the vector layer, and the \nimages themselves were selected. Eventually, all the selected thermal \nimages were analysed using standard image processing software (DJI \nThermal Analysis Tool 3 for the images collected by the UAV, and FLIR \nFig. 2.

Here, the maximum tem­\nperature (in the case of single or multiple hotspots) or the average \ntemperature (in the case of diffused anomalies, such as substring, \nextended, or string) within the polygon was compared with the average \ntemperature within a second polygon drawn over the closest healthy \nsolar panel. This healthy panel was assumed to be a fair representation \nof the operating temperature of non-defective modules. For single and \nmultiple hotspots, evaluating the maximum hotspot (even though more \nsusceptible to measurement noise) rather than the mean temperature \nvalue of the panel containing the anomaly was considered more \nconservative, as averaging the temperature over an extended area might \ndilute the thermal defect without highlighting it if it falls below the \nassigned threshold. \nResults and discussion \nExamples of the different classes of anomalies are shown in Fig. 5. \nEach figure shows the visual and thermal images (captured by drone and \nairplane) of the module affected by one or more thermal defects (framed \nin red) along with the reference temperatures estimated for a neigh­\nbouring “healthy” module (framed in light blue). These illustrative im­\nages are provided for hotspot thermal defects (left-hand side), a \nuniformly overheated module classified as an extended thermal defect \n(centre), and a string of disconnected modules (right-hand side). \nAnalysis of thermal anomalies \nFrom the analysis of each thermal anomaly, the distribution of \ntemperature difference ΔT (between the defective spot area and the \nreference temperatures) has been obtained for each inspection and solar \nPV system. \nFigs. 6–9 convey the values of ΔT recorded for System 1 and the two \ndifferent inspections I1 (drone and airplane both with LW thermal \ncamera) and I2 (drone with LW camera and airplane with MW camera). \nThe data are differentiated by the defect category and present, for each \ndefective module (identified by a code number), the ΔT value calculated \nfrom the thermal patterns by UAV and airplane. A mark (*) was inserted \nto indicate modules found as defective by one inspection and regular by \nthe other one. \nFigures show at a glance that the majority of thermal defects, \nmonitored during the first (I1) and the second (I2) inspections, were \ncorrectly identified by both aerial platforms. As the inspections were \nperformed more than one month apart, some defects, typically mild \nhotspots, were identified only during one survey (and not both); this \ncircumstance may be ascribed to the presence of soiling rather than real \nthermal defects. Interestingly, three additional defective strings were \ndetected during the second inspection (I2) as shown in Fig. 9, probably \ndue to the disconnection of a series of modules. It is worth noting that \nthe analysis of the temporal evolution of failures was out of the scope of \nthis research, mainly focused on the comparison between UAV and \nairplane thermal measurements. In this regard, the comparison between \nthe ΔT values, averaged among each defect category (ΔTavg) for both \naerial platforms and inspected PV plants, is illustrated in Table 4. Cat­\negories with fewer than 9 defects were considered statistically not \nrelevant. ΔT was averaged among values of defective modules, except \nfor category E, where the ΔT of the string (and not of each affected \nmodule) was considered. The deviation is calculated as the difference \nbetween the mean ΔT detected by airplane relative to the mean ΔT \ndetected by UAV. Considering the inspections of System 1, featuring the \nlarger number of defective modules, the mean ΔT based on the thermal \nTable 2 \nSummary of the characteristics of the thermal cameras mounted on UAV and aircraft platforms for the monitored PV plants.  \nPV \nSystem \nInspection code (and \ndate) \nAerial \nplatform \nIR spectral response code (and \nrange) \nIR \ntechnology \nIR pixels \nIR \naccuracy \nIR sensitivity \n(NETD) \nIR frame rate \n1 \nI1 (5/4/2022) \nUAV \nLW (8–14 μm) \nuncooled \n640 × 512 \n± 2 K \n50 mK \n30 Hz \n1 \n=\nairplane \nLW (7.5–12.5 μm) \ncooled \n1280 ×\n1024 \n± 1 K \n< 40 mK \nup to 60 Hz \n2 \n=\nUAV \nLW (8–14 μm) \nuncooled \n640 × 512 \n± 2 K \n50 mK \n30 Hz \n2 \n=\nairplane \nLW (7.5–12.5 μm) \ncooled \n1280 ×\n1024 \n± 1 K \n< 40 mK \nup to 60 Hz \n1 \nI2 (13/5/2022) \nUAV \nLW (8–14 μm) \nuncooled \n640 × 512 \n± 2 K \n50 mK \n30 Hz \n1 \n=\nairplane \nMW (3–5 μm) \ncooled \n1280 ×\n1024 \n± 1 K \n30 mK \nup to 181 \nHz \n2 \n=\nUAV \nLW (8–14 μm) \nuncooled \n640 × 512 \n± 2 K \n50 mK \n30 Hz \n2 \n=\nairplane \nMW (3–5 μm) \ncooled \n1280 ×\n1024 \n± 1 K \n30 mK \nup to 181 \nHz  \nTable 3 \nDescription of thermal defect categories identified through aIRT inspection. \nSubcategories are introduced for single and multiple hotspots (*observed defects \nunder categories C, D, and E had a ΔT always less than 7 K and no subcategories \nwere considered).  \nThermal \ndefect \ncategory \nDescription \nCode \nThermal defect \nsubcategory* \nCode \nTemperature \ndifference from \nnormal operating \ndevice ΔT [K] \nSingle \nhotspot \nA cell, or a \npart of it, is \nhot inside the \ninspected \nmodule \nA   \n>2  \nmild \nA1 \nbetween 2 and 7 \nintermediate \nA2 \nbetween 7 and \n10 \nsevere \nA3 \n> 10 \nMultiple \nhotspots \nMore hotspots \nare present \ninside the \ninspected \nmodule \nB   \n>2  \nmild \nA1 \nbetween 2 and 7 \nintermediate \nA2 \nbetween 7 and \n10 \nsevere \nA3 \n> 10 \nSubstring \nA substring of \nthe inspected \nmodule is \nuniformly hot \nC   \n>2 \nExtended \nThe entire \ninspected \nmodule is \nuniformly hot \nD   \n>2 \nString \nSeveral \nmodules \nforming a \nstring are \nuniformly hot \nE   \n>2  \nG.

As all defective modules and \nstrings identified by both aerial platforms are considered, the average \nΔT calculated according to the measurements by aircraft differs by only \n0.23 K from the mean ΔT evaluated by UAV measurements, confirming \nthe reliability of fault detection by the airplane equipped with fast \nthermal cameras. This reliability holds true regardless of the different \nspectral operating ranges (LW for inspection I1 and MW for inspection \nI2) of the sensor, seemingly not affecting the quality of comparative \nresults. \nThe number of thermal anomalies \nThe summary of thermal anomalies, in terms of number of defective \nmodules, identified for both PV systems, and relative to the total number \nof modules, is shown in Fig. 10. The inspection of the figure reveals that \nboth aerial platforms detected approximately the same percentage of \ndefective modules. The number of defective modules remained constant \nover time for System 2 (about 3.5 % of the total number of modules for \nboth inspections I1 and I2). Conversely, for System 1, the number \nincreased from 5.4 to 6.9 %, attributed to the growing number of \ndefected strings, as explained in the comment of Fig. 9. Table 5 reports \nthe number of detected faults and affected modules, providing details for \neach fault category. The number of faults aligns with the number of \nmodules for single hotspots (A), disconnected substrings (C), and defects \nextended to the entire module (D), while the number of faults exceeds \nthe number of modules for multiple hotspots (B) and it is lower for PV \nstrings (D), as a disconnected string affects a relatively large number of \nmodules. \nFor both PV systems (1 and 2) and inspections (I1 and I2), fault \ncategories C, D, and E were correctly identified by UAV and airplane \ninspections, with the sole exception of System 2, where the airplane \ndetected one defective substring less than the drone. Differences in the \nnumber of detected faults are more evident for single and multiple \nhotspot defects, likely due to the reduced area occupied by the thermal \nanomaly making their correct identification somewhat critical, espe­\ncially from inspections conducted with the airplane, having a lower \nground sampling resolution. To provide a more detailed overview, \nTable 6 has been included to show the detected single and multiple \nhotspots based on their level of severity. \nDetailed results reported in Table 6 show that, for both plants, all the \nmodules with severe multi-hotspot defects (B3) are identified by both \nplatforms, except for the first inspection (I1) of System 1, where the \nairplane detected six severe modules with multi-hotspots against five \ndetected by UAV. Regarding modules with a single hotspot, small dif­\nferences arise between UAV and airplane inspections: for System 1 and \nInspection I1 three severe hotspot anomalies (A3), according to UAV \nsurvey, are apparently classified as intermediate by airplane survey. \nIn Table 7 the number of defective modules detected by UAVs and \nairplanes is directly compared (overall and for categories), with \nparticular attention given to the level of agreement shown by data ob­\ntained through the two aerial platforms. As noted earlier, the two plat­\nforms operated at different geometric resolutions at ground. \nSpecifically, UAV-based inspections were conducted according to the \nstandard requirements of 3 cm per pixel resolution, while the aircraft- \nbased inspections had a low resolution at ground even if performed \nunder the most appropriate conditions (in terms of IR camera resolution \nand flight altitude). This circumstance may suggest that thermal data \nprovided by UAV-based inspections are more precise than those \ncaptured by aircraft; on the other hand, the cooled IR camera mounted \non aircraft has higher accuracy than the uncooled one working on UAV, \ncontributing to partially mitigate the loss of resolution associated with \nFig. 3.

Since the UAV-based inspection is currently consid­\nered the gold standard for monitoring of PV plants, the thermal data \ngathered by the UAV platform are regarded as the reference ones. As \ndiscussed previously, thermal anomalies concerning defective substrings \n(C), the whole module (D), and strings of more modules (E) detected by \nUAV (712 defective modules) are, in the vast majority of cases, effec­\ntively captured by both platforms. In fact, 709 defective modules, cor­\nresponding to 99.6 % of defective modules identified by UAV and \naffected by C, D, and E thermal signature categories, are also detected by \nthe airplane surveys. In contrast, the comparison is less favourable when \nreferring to the 110 modules with single and multiple hotspots identified \nby UAV, as only 96 (i.e., the 87.3 %) containing type-A and B faults \nobserved by UAV surveys were also confirmed by the inspections carried \nout with the airplane. A better agreement is expected to be attained in \nthe near future with the advent of fast (cooled) thermal cameras having \na larger resolution, allowing the resolution at the ground of UAV and \nairplane surveys to be comparable. \nTable 4 \nAveraged ΔT values for detective modules (and strings) detected by UAV and \nairplane.  \nSystem \nInspection \nDefect \ncategory \nΔTavg [K], \nUAV \nΔTavg [K], \naircraft \nDeviation \n[K] \n1 \nI1 \nA  \n4.98  \n4.65  \n−0.33 \nI2 \nA  \n5.22  \n4.76  \n−0.46 \nI1 \nB  \n8.82  \n9.75  \n+0.93 \nI2 \nB  \n10.11  \n9.67  \n−0.44 \nI1 \nE  \n4.73  \n4.54  \n−0.19 \nI2 \nE  \n4.38  \n4.58  \n+0.20 \n1 + 2 \nI1 + I2 \nA  \n6.59  \n6.04  \n−0.55 \nB  \n9.21  \n9.09  \n−0.12 \nC + D  \n4.23  \n4.27  \n+0.04 \nE  \n4.86  \n4.90  \n+0.04 \nAll  \n6.70  \n6.47  \n¡0.23  \nFig. 10.

Within the limits of an analysis conducted for only two \nplants, albeit repeated more than a month apart, the excellent agree­\nment found in terms of identifying defective modules from thermal \nanalysis is encouraging regarding the use of an aircraft, rather than a \ndrone, for this type of investigation. \nComparative analysis of costs \nAs discussed in the previous sections, IR-based results from the two \naerial techniques demonstrated substantial quantitative and qualitative \nagreement. Beyond technical aspects, it is crucial to compare the eco­\nnomic aspects of the two techniques. While UAV-based inspections, \nwhich are the market standard, entail daily equipment and workforce \ncosts not as high as those of the airplane, the latter platform, however, \nallows for coverage of a larger daily area. This implies that a threshold \nvalue, based on the size (and capacity) of the inspected plants, is likely to \ndetermine which technique is more economically viable. Costs include \ntravel and accommodation for the operator(s), rental costs of the aerial \nplatform (including workforce), rental costs of the thermal camera, and \nthe expenses for image and data processing. For UAV-based solution, the \ndrone pilot needs to reach the PV plant before flight operations, and \naccommodation expenses increase for inspections lasting more than one \nday. Aircraft inspections do not incur these expenses, as the pilot typi­\ncally returns to headquarters at the end of each day. Currently, the rental \ncost for the aircraft, including the pilot and cooled thermal camera, is \nsignificantly higher (2700 €/day for the carrier and the pilot, plus 120 \n€/day for the cooled thermal camera rental) than that for the UAV (800 \n€/day, inclusive of costs for the operator(s) and the uncooled thermal \ncamera rental). These prices were based on actual costs incurred by this \nresearch group for inspecting PV plants, in Italy, with a total power of 2 \nGW during the year 2022, using both UAV and aircraft. Finally, the \nworking cost associated with image and data processing is equivalent \n(30 €/MW for both platforms). It is worth noting that the inspection time \nusing UAVs (with the prescribed resolution of 3 cm/pixel) ranges from 5 \nto 60 min per MW [15,16], depending on the degree of overlap in \ninfrared images (i.e., the longer is the flight, the higher is the number of \nphotos for the same module, resulting in a more precise mosaicking). \nTaking into account the useful insolation hours (module-plane-irradi­\nance larger than 600 W/m2) and the time required for take-off, landing, \nand battery replacement, it can be assumed that the UAV platform can \ninspect a maximum of about 20 MW in a single working day. According \nto the experience gained on field by this research group, the largest PV \nplant (or multiple plants located in the same area) that can be covered by \nthe airplane in one working day is approximately 300 MW.

The comparison between the overall costs of the two \naerial platforms is illustrated in Fig. 11 as a function of the inspected \nplant power, extended up to 300 MW (i.e., the maximum plant size \npotentially inspected by the airplane in a single working day). Since the \nUAV-based inspections, as observed earlier, do not permit the investi­\ngation of more than 20 MW per day, the corresponding cost trend is not a \ncontinuous rising line (as seen for the aircraft-based inspections) but is \ninterrupted (and sharply rises) every 20 MW due to the increasing \nnumber of working days. The figure shows that for inspections of any \nplant requiring more than two working days (i.e., PV plants with a \npower larger than 40 MW) the use of the airplane is economically more \nconvenient. For instance, a PV plant of 41 MW is inspected by UAV in \nthree working days at a total cost of 4180 €, against 4050 € required by \nthe airplane solution. Furthermore, the threshold decreases (and con­\nditions for the use of aircraft become more favourable) if the same \namount of PV power is spread across a cluster of smaller plants in the \nsame region. In this case, the daily maximum inspection capacity of the \nUAV is reduced due to the time spent by the UAV operator(s) to travel \nfrom one plant to the other(s), with further additional travelling costs to \nbe accounted for. Conversely, the daily maximum inspection capacity of \nthe airplane is barely affected, as it can move from one plant to another \nwithout landing and at a fast speed. \nConclusions \nThis study presents two distinct techniques for aerial infrared ther­\nmography (aIRT) inspection of PV plants, employing remote sensing via \nUAV and aircraft platforms. Comparative results, in terms of detection of \nthermal defects in two PV installations, revealed that inspections con­\nducted using an airplane equipped with high-speed thermal cameras \ndemonstrated good agreement with more routine monitoring by UAVs, \nwhich utilized standard, uncooled thermal cameras. The agreement was \nobserved both qualitatively (in terms of defect types) and quantitatively \n(in terms of number of defects). Regarding the most critical defects, such \nas defective substring, entire module, and string of modules, 99.6 % of \nthem were detected by both aerial platforms. Furthermore, 87.3 % of \nmodules with single or multiple hotspots, identified by UAV surveys, \nwere also detected by airplane inspections. Overall, about 98 % of \nthermal defects captured by drone inspections were confirmed by \nairplane inspections, with only a 0.23 K difference in ΔT, calculated by \naveraging values among all identified defective modules and strings, \nmeasured by the two aerial platforms. The pros of the UAV platform \ninclude high resolution at ground, adjustable based on the flight alti­\ntude, and relatively low costs of the drone and the mounted uncooled IR \ncamera. The cons include relatively high inspection times compared to \naircraft inspections, impacting manpower costs. On the other hand, the \nmain advantage of the aircraft platform is the short survey duration, \nmaking it particularly suitable for inspecting very large sites. However, \nthe mounted cooled IR cameras are much more expensive compared to \nthe uncooled cameras, and hiring costs of the carrier are higher. \nRegarding the ability to capture the defective modules through ther­\nmographic analyses, aerial inspections by airplanes, documented for the \nfirst time in this research within the knowledge of the authors, were \nfound to be reliable as UAV inspections. Compared to the more common \nUAV-based surveys, inspections by aircraft may present an attractive \nalternative for monitoring large PV plants or numerous plants located \nwithin a close area, specifically, for PV plants of more than 40 MW, as \nthe costs of hiring the instrumentation (high-speed and -resolution \nthermal cameras) and the airplane are counterbalanced by the reduced \ninspection duration and team size. This outcome is considered valuable \ninformation for PV stakeholders, operators, service providers, and \nresearchers. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nGiovanni Tanda: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal anal­\nysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – original draft, \nWriting – review & editing.

E-mail(s): danuta.paraficz@ffhs.ch;\nebrar.oezkalay@supsi.ch; mauro.caccivio@supsi.ch;\nContributing authors: Ralf.Jandl@ffhs.ch;\n†These authors contributed equally to this work.\n1 Introduction\nThe increasing global demand for renewable energy has placed photovoltaics (PV)\nat the forefront of sustainable energy solutions. Switzerland, like many other coun-\ntries, has set ambitious carbon neutrality goals, aiming for net zero emissions by 2050\nthrough the widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies. Among these, solar\npower has emerged as a key contributor due to its cost competitiveness, market pen-\netration, and significant energy potential. However, to ensure the long-term viability\nand efficiency of PV systems, improving their reliability and durability is crucial.\nOne of the major challenges in PV technology is the early detection and classifi-\ncation of defects and failures in solar modules. These defects can significantly impact\nperformance, leading to increased degradation rates and higher maintenance costs.\nCurrent defect detection methodologies rely on visual inspections and electrolumines-\ncence (EL) imaging, which often require multiple shots with different cameras, leading\nto inconsistencies and inefficiencies. A more robust and automated approach is needed\nto enhance defect identification, quantify performance losses, and ultimately extend\nthe lifespan of PV modules.\n1\nThe objectives of this project are two fold. First, we aim to develop a novel method-\nology for the quantitative and timely detection of defects and failures in PV modules\nthrough advanced image analysis techniques combined with artificial intelligence (AI).\nUsing an ultrahigh-resolution multispectral camera with UV to IR sensitivity, appro-\npriate filters, and a specialized lighting setup, this research seeks to improve defect\nidentification at the cell level. Secondly, we present a novel approach to predicting the\nmaximum power point (Pmpp) of solar panels by integrating image-based features\nand tabular data using a deep learning framework. The proposed method leverages a\ncombination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing and fully\nconnected layers for tabular data, enabling accurate predictions of solar panel perfor-\nmance. The proposed methodologies leverage neural networks to automatically classify\nfailure modes and correlate them with module performance losses. The effectiveness\nof the approach will be validated using naturally aged PV modules from the TISO\nplant and other modern modules with field-induced defects Figure 3.\nFig. 1 Defected TISO cell as seen in EL, UV and VIS.\nThe results of this project will have significant implications for the photovoltaic\nindustry, enabling a more efficient and accurate defect tracking methodology. The\nadoption of AI-driven defect detection techniques can benefit research laboratories,\nmanufacturing facilities, and operational PV systems by providing a quantitative,\nscalable, and reproducible method for evaluating module performance. This approach\nwill contribute to improving the reliability of photovoltaic energy, reducing waste and\nsupporting the transition to a more sustainable future.\nVision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in con-\nventional RGB image processing tasks. However, extending their application to\nmultichannel imaging data, common in remote sensing, presents significant challenges.\nTraining ViTs on heterogeneous data that comprise layers captured through diverse\ntechnologies, e.g. UV, IR, VIS, hinders the model’s ability to leverage complemen-\ntary information, leading to suboptimal results. This problem is solved by recent\nadvancements in computer vision for multi-channel image analysis have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for photovoltaic (PV) panel defect classification, particularly\nwhen handling sparse or missing imaging modalities. The Channel Vision Trans-\nformer (ChannelViT) architecture emerges as a particularly suitable foundation for\nthis task due to its inherent capacity to process independent channel information while\nmaintaining robustness to missing inputs [1]. This report provides a comprehensive\n2\ntechnical framework for the implementation of a photovoltaic defect classification sys-\ntem that integrates visual, electroluminescence (EL), and ultraviolet (UV) imaging\ndata while addressing critical challenges in cross-domain generalization and missing\nchannel robustness.\n2 Instrumentation and Imaging Methodology\n2.1 Procurement of Instrumentation, Setup, and Calibration\nThe first step in this work package is the analysis and procurement of the necessary\ninstrumentation for multispectral image acquisition. The selection of an industrial-\ngrade medium format camera with the highest native resolution ensures optimal data\nacquisition and detail preservation. To prevent optical bottlenecks, an appropriate lens\nwill be chosen to cover the entire module surface without the need for image merging.\nA PhaseOne/Linos camera, previously tested in preliminary experiments, serves\nas a viable starting point when paired with a suitable lens. The instrumentation setup\nwill be designed to maximize repeatability and accurate color reproduction through\nthe use of calibration points.\nThe planned instrumentation includes:\n• PhaseOne iXM MV150f 150 Mpixel multispectral camera (to be procured);\n• High-resolution wide lens with UV, IR, and visible light transmittance (to be\nprocured);\n• Motorized filter wheel for switching filters (to be procured);\n• Two LED lamps for visible light, mounted at a 45-degree angle to prevent glass\nreflections (to be procured);\n• Two UV LED lamps for photoluminescence, mounted at a 45-degree angle to avoid\nglass reflections (to be procured);\n• Power supply to trigger electroluminescence in the modules (to be procured);\n• Color reference target for accurate color space determination (available).\nThe setup utilized in the feasibility study, as illustrated in Figure 5, provides a\nsolid foundation for the calibration and acquisition processes. The calibration phase\nis critical to ensure uniform color range capture across different modules.\n2.2 Logistics, Preparation, and Image Acquisition\nA diverse set of photovoltaic modules exhibiting defects from long-term outdoor expo-\nsure will be analyzed. These modules incorporate different cell technologies to provide\na comprehensive dataset. Among the sets available:\n• Modules with IBC cells from a walkable solar catamaran (2010-2015);\n• The TISO PV plant dataset, containing 240 modules naturally aged over 35 years;\n• Additional sets from ongoing reliability projects at SUPSI and other PV installers.\nModules will be cleaned, labeled, and barcoded for efficient traceability.

These\nmultispectral images will be crucial for training AI algorithms to identify cell failures.\nDefect detection will be significantly enhanced through multispectral imaging,\nwhich allows differentiation based on wavelength response. For example:\n• UV light aids in detecting delamination;\n• Visible light highlights browning effects;\n• IR imaging reveals hotspot formation.\nSome defects, such as hotspots, exhibit unique patterns across multiple wave-\nlengths, making multispectral imaging a more powerful diagnostic tool than conven-\ntional electroluminescence analysis.\n3 Data\n3.1 Data description\nWe use for training data\n• Training DURAMAT data ’good’: 5877, ’crack’: 3242, ’cross’: 3662, ’dark’: 2179\n• Training our own labeled data: ’good’: 109, ’crack’: 83, ’cross’: 26, ’dark’: 88,\n’crackcross’: 24\n• And for prediction we use Infinity: ’good’: 2112, ’crack’: 39, ’cross’: 156, ’dark’:\n21, ’crackcross’: 15, ’crackdark’: 11, ’corrosion’: 306, ’corrosioncross’: 58, ’corrosion-\ncrackcross’: 4, ’corrosioncrack’: 3\n4\n4 Electrical Measurements of Module Performance\nTo correlate imaging results with functional degradation, electrical measurements will\nbe conducted using a flasher simulator.

The proposed methodology integrates state-of-the-art segmentation mod-\nels and robust data handling mechanisms to ensure efficient and accurate segmentation\nof image datasets to achieve high performance and scalability.\nFig. 3 Automatic TISO cell detection and segmentation presented in Electroluminescence\nThe segmentation of panel images is a critical task in various domains, including\nindustrial inspection, scientific research, and automated quality control. Traditional\nmanual segmentation methods are time-consuming and prone to errors, especially\nwhen dealing with large datasets. To address these challenges, we propose an auto-\nmated segmentation pipeline that combines advanced deep learning models with\nefficient data processing techniques. This chapter details the implementation of the\npipeline.\n5\nThe segmentation process is driven by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a\ncutting-edge deep learning framework developed for generalized image segmentation\ntasks. In this module, we implemented two key functions to facilitate robust and\nautomated segmentation of photovoltaic (PV) panel images:\n• Automatic Segmentation: The segmentSAMImage automatic function is used to\nidentify the centroids of individual cells within the panel. One limitation of SAM’s\nautomatic detection mode is its tendency to produce overlapping masks by seg-\nmenting the same object multiple times. To mitigate this, the automatic mode is\nemployed primarily for estimating the panel layout rather than for direct segmen-\ntation. By analyzing peak patterns between detected centroid coordinates using\nSciPy’s find peaks function, we accurately infer the number of rows and columns\nof cells. This method eliminates the need for manual input and provides a reliable,\ndata-driven mechanism for grid estimation.\n• Predictive Segmentation: The segmentSAMImage predict function utilizes SAM’s\npredictor in a guided fashion, applying predefined grid coordinates derived from the\nautomatic segmentation phase. This approach improves precision by constraining\nthe segmentation process within the expected cell boundaries, resulting in cleaner\nand more consistent mask generation.\nBoth functions incorporate OpenCV for preprocessing and image manipulation tasks,\nand employ SciPy’s signal processing tools for grid structure estimation. This combi-\nnation ensures accurate, repeatable segmentation of complex panel layouts (see Figure\n3).\nFollowing segmentation, the identified regions are post-processed to enhance the\nquality and usability of the results. This includes alignment of segmented images and\nadjustment of bounding boxes to account for variability in panel size, perspective\ndistortion, and slight misalignments. These refinements ensure that the extracted cell\nregions are properly standardized for subsequent analysis or model training.\nThe proposed segmentation pipeline was evaluated on various datasets of PV panel\nimages and demonstrated high accuracy in isolating individual cells. The integra-\ntion of SAM’s automatic mask generation significantly reduced the need for manual\nintervention, particularly in grid estimation.\nThe modular design of the pipeline enhances its adaptability and scalability, mak-\ning it suitable for a variety of imaging conditions and panel configurations. This\nflexibility, combined with robust segmentation performance, positions the proposed\nsystem as a practical tool for both industrial inspection and academic research\ninvolving PV panel analysis.\n6 Architectural Foundations for Multi-Channel PV\nAnalysis\nAnalyzing photovoltaic (PV) panels through multiple imaging modalities—such as\nvisual, electroluminescence (EL), and ultraviolet (UV)—demands models that can\nhandle heterogeneous spectral inputs effectively. Traditional CNNs and ViTs trained\non RGB images fall short in this context due to their inability to explicitly account\n6\nfor modality-specific characteristics and interactions. This section outlines the archi-\ntectural innovations introduced to address these challenges, including the adaptation\nof ChannelViT and the integration of a novel sampling strategy for robust training\nunder modality variation.\n6.1 ChannelViT Adaptation for Solar Cells Classification\nChannelViT extends the standard Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to support\nmulti-channel inputs by treating each imaging modality as a separate input stream.\nThis is achieved through a specialized embedding scheme that creates distinct patch\ntokens for each channel, while maintaining shared spatial positional information. This\ndesign ensures both independent and joint representation learning across spectral\nmodalities. Key architectural adaptations include:\n• Modality-Specific Feature Encoding: Each channel (e.g., visual, EL, UV) undergoes\nan independent linear projection to produce initial patch embeddings. These projec-\ntions are ”tied” across the spatial domain but are specific to each modality, enabling\nthe network to extract features that are most relevant to each imaging type.\n• Cross-Channel Attention Mechanisms: The transformer layers are configured to\nallow interaction between patches from different modalities. This enables the model\nto learn relationships and correlations between defects that may manifest differently\nacross imaging spectra.\n• Learnable Channel Embeddings: To preserve and exploit modality-specific informa-\ntion, learnable embeddings are assigned to each channel. These channel embeddings\nare added to each patch token to guide the model in distinguishing between spectral\ninputs during attention computation.\nThe patch embedding for a given channel c and spatial position p is formulated as:\nzc,p = PosEmb(p) + ChnEmb(c) + Wxc,p\n(1)\nwhere PosEmb(p) is the positional embedding, ChnEmb(c) is the learnable channel\nembedding, W is the projection matrix, and xc,p is the input patch from channel c.\nThis formulation allows the network to maintain spatial coherence while dis-\ntinguishing between spectral modalities, effectively modeling both intra- and inter-\nchannel information.\n6.2 Hierarchical Channel Sampling for Robustness to Missing\nModalities\nIn real-world PV diagnostics, certain imaging channels may be unavailable at deploy-\nment time due to hardware limitations or operational constraints. To train a model\nthat remains robust under such conditions, we introduce Hierarchical Channel Sam-\npling (HCS)—a training strategy that exposes the model to variable subsets of\nchannels in a structured manner.\nUnlike traditional dropout, which may randomly omit channels without constraint,\nHCS systematically samples all possible channel subset sizes during training. This\n7\nencourages the model to learn flexible representations that generalize across any\ncombination of available modalities.\nThe sampling process consists of two uniform selections:\n• A random integer m is drawn uniformly from the range [1, C] the total number of\nchannels.\n• A subset Cm of size m is selected uniformly at random from the full set of channels.\nThis approach ensures equitable exposure to all subset combinations over time, reduc-\ning reliance on any single modality and improving the model’s resilience to missing\ndata. By embedding this mechanism into the training loop, ChannelViT learns to\nadaptively process whatever subset of modalities is available, making it highly suitable\nfor practical PV inspection scenarios.\n6.3 Multi-Label Learning via Custom Loss Function\nPV cells often exhibit multiple defect types simultaneously (e.g., microcracks, inactive\nregions, discoloration), making multi-label classification essential. To accommodate\nthis, we modify the ChannelViT output head to use sigmoid activations instead of\nsoftmax and replace the cross-entropy loss with a binary classification loss function.\nThe final loss used is:\nLmulti-label = BCEWithLogitsLoss(ypred, ytrue)\nThis enables the model to independently assess the presence of each defect type,\nallowing for multiple concurrent class activations per sample. This setup aligns more\nclosely with the real-world PV panel defect annotations, where defect categories\nfrequently overlap.\n7 Preprocessing Pipeline\nIn this study, the preprocessing pipeline was designed to handle multi-channel image\ndata from photovoltaic (PV) panels, including Electroluminescence (EL), Ultraviolet\n(UV), and Visible (VIS) imaging modalities. The preprocessing steps ensure that the\ndata is clean, normalized, and ready for input into the deep learning model.\nFor each PV panel in each channel (EL, UV, VIS) the mean and standard deviation\nof pixel values were calculated. Image data were normalized to zero mean and unit\nvariance per channel (EL, UV, VIS) and per PV panel, to ensure that the pixel values\nof the images are scaled consistently across all channels and that each cell represents\nrelative difference of the brightness across the whole PV panel. This step is crucial for\nstabilizing the training process and improving model convergence.\nTo create multi-channel input data, the grayscale images from the EL, UV, and\nVIS modalities were stacked along the channel dimension. This resulted in a 3-channel\nimage for each sample, where each channel corresponds to one imaging modality. This\nstep ensures that the model receives a unified input format.\n8\nThe labels for the images were processed to ensure compatibility with the multi-\nlabel classification task were converted to one-hot encoded vectors. The data was split\ninto training and validation 70//30 split sets to evaluate the models performance.\nIn this study, the preprocessing pipeline was developed to accommodate multi-\nchannel image data from photovoltaic (PV) panels, including Electroluminescence\n(EL), Ultraviolet (UV), and Visible (VIS) imaging modalities. The goal of this pipeline\nis to ensure that the data is clean, normalized, and consistently formatted for input\ninto the deep learning model.\nFor each PV panel and for each imaging modality (EL, UV, VIS), the mean and\nstandard deviation of pixel intensities were computed. Images were then normalized\nto have zero mean and unit variance on a per-channel and per-panel basis. This nor-\nmalization ensures consistent pixel scaling across all modalities and allows the model\nto focus on relative brightness differences within each panel—an essential factor for\ndetecting subtle defects. This step is critical for stabilizing training and improving\nmodel convergence.\nTo construct the multi-channel input, the grayscale EL, UV, and VIS images were\nstacked along the channel axis, producing a single 3-channel input where each channel\nrepresents one modality. This unified format allows the model to jointly process multi-\nspectral information during training and inference.\nLabel data were also prepared to support multi-label classification. Each sample’s\nlabels were converted to one-hot encoded vectors to enable the detection of multiple\ndefect types per image. Finally, the dataset was split into training and validation\nsubsets using a 70/30 ratio to evaluate model performance effectively.\n7.1 Data Augmentation Phase\nTo further improve the model’s robustness, data augmentation played a vital role by\ngenerating additional training samples from the original dataset. This process involved\napplying a range of image transformations—including rotation, shifting, and horizontal\nflipping—to increase the diversity of the training data. These augmentations effectively\nsimulated real-world variations such as different panel orientations, camera angles, and\nenvironmental factors like misalignments. As a result, the model was better equipped\nto generalize to unseen data, reducing the risk of overfitting and enhancing its real-\nworld performance. By artificially expanding the dataset, the model was exposed to a\nbroader spectrum of input conditions.\n8 Experimental Validation Protocol\nThe evaluation process in this study was designed to rigorously assess the perfor-\nmance and generalization ability of the deep learning models trained for photovoltaic\n(PV) panel defect classification. To rigorously assess the generalization capability of\nthe trained model, the Infinity dataset was completely excluded from the training and\nvalidation phases. This dataset served as an independent test set, ensuring that no\ninformation from Infinity influenced model optimization or hyperparameter selection.\nAfter model training, predictions were generated for the Infinity data, and performance\nwas evaluated using several metrics, with particular emphasis on the confusion matrix.\n9\nThe confusion matrix provided a detailed breakdown of the model’s classification accu-\nracy across all classes, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement when\napplied to previously unseen data. This approach allowed for an unbiased evaluation\nof the model’s real-world applicability and robustness.\nFig. 4 Normalized Confusion Matrix: The plotnormalizedconfusionmatrixfunctiongeneratedheatmapsoftheconfusionmatri\n8.1 Cross-Domain Evaluation Methodology\nModel\nDURAMAT Acc\nINFINITY Acc\nZero-Shot Acc\nViT-Base\n92.1%\n85.3%\n68.4%\nChannelViT\n94.7%\n89.1%\n73.2%\nChannelViT+HCS\n93.8%\n91.4%\n81.9%\nTable 1 Performance metrics on different datasets.\n9\nPredicting Solar Panel Performance Using Deep\nLearning and Tabular Data Integration\nThe dataset includes preprocessed images, defect classifications for individual cells,\nand tabular data extracted from CSV files. The model’s performance is evaluated\nusing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and\nR² score, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting solar panel performance.\nThe accurate prediction of solar panel performance is critical for optimizing energy\nproduction and maintenance planning. Traditional methods rely on either image-based\n10\nanalysis or tabular data, but rarely both. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning\nmodel that combines image features and tabular data to predict the maximum power\npoint (Pmpp) of solar panels. The integration of these data modalities allows the\nmodel to capture both visual and numerical patterns, improving prediction accuracy.\n9.1 Dataset Preparation\nThe dataset consists of three main components:\nImage Data: Preprocessed grayscale images of solar panels, including UV, EL,\nand VI modalities, concatenated along the channel dimension. Tabular Data: Defect\nclassifications for individual cells (classes) and additional numerical features extracted\nfrom CSV files. Target Variable: The maximum power point (Pmpp) of the solar panel,\nextracted from the CSV data. 2.1 Image Preprocessing Images were resized to 224x224\npixels to match the input size of the ResNet18 model. Each image was normalized\nusing mean and standard deviation values of 0.5. The preprocessing pipeline was\nimplemented using PyTorch’s transforms module.\n9.2 Tabular Data\nThe tabular data includes:\nDefect Classes: An array indicating the defect classification for each cell in the\nsolar panel.\nThe proposed model integrates image and tabular data using a hybrid architecture.\n9.3 Model Architecture\nThe model consists of two branches:\nCNN Branch: A pretrained ResNet18 model processes the image data, extracting\na 512-dimensional feature vector. Tabular Branch: A fully connected neural network\nprocesses the tabular data, including defect classifications and CSV features. The\noutputs of both branches are concatenated and passed through a regression head to\npredict the Pmpp value.\n9.4 Training and Evaluation\nThe dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets. The model was\ntrained for 30 epochs using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss\nfunction. The training and validation losses were monitored to ensure convergence.\n9.5\nMetrics\nThe model’s performance was evaluated using the following metrics:\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between\npredictions and targets. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared\ndifference between predictions and targets. R² Score: Indicates how well the predictions\nfit the data. 4.2 Results The model achieved the following results on the validation\ndataset:\nMAE: 1.23 MSE: 2.45 R² Score: 0.89\n11\nFig. 5\nThe predictions were visualized against the true target values to assess the model’s\naccuracy. A scatter plot of predictions vs. targets showed a strong correlation, with\nmost points lying close to the diagonal.\n10 Conclusion\nThe ChannelViT architecture, when enhanced with Hierarchical Channel Sampling\nand cross-modal self-supervised pretraining, provides a robust foundation for PV\ndefect classification across variable imaging modalities. Future extensions should con-\nsider integrating physics-based models of PV cell degradation to constrain the feature\nspace and improve generalization. The proposed architecture demonstrates > 80%\nzero-shot accuracy in controlled tests, establishing a strong baseline for production\nsystems requiring minimal retraining on new PV technologies. This study demon-\nstrates the effectiveness of integrating image and tabular data for predicting solar\npanel performance. The proposed model leverages the strengths of CNNs for image\nprocessing and fully connected layers for tabular data, achieving high accuracy in pre-\ndicting Pmpp. Future work will explore the inclusion of additional features, such as\nenvironmental conditions, to further improve the model’s performance.\n6.

It \nhas been created to help authors prepare LaTeX manuscripts for journals formatted in New Journal Design (NJD), \nwhich is Wiley’s standard article layout. See the LaTeX page on Wiley’s Author Services site where this template \nis hosted for details about journals using NJD and their font, number of columns, and reference style for authors \nwho would like to simulate these using LaTeX. If the journal to which you want to submit your manuscript is not \nusing NJD, check with the Editorial Office of that journal to ask if they have their own journal-specific LaTeX \ntemplate. It is possible to use it for journals not using NJD even though it won’t look like the final typeset article. \nThis LaTeX template provides standard coding which Wiley’s vendors can successfully convert to XML for \ntypesetting purposes. (Please be aware that manuscript files will be converted by our typesetters into the journal’s \nfinal specifications for typeset articles, regardless of the reference, font and column number format selected in the \nLaTeX manuscript.) \nThis NJDv5 LaTeX template has been created to (1) provide proper guidance to simplify the process, (2) \nsimulate approximately how the article will look once published, and (3) reduce time and manual intervention \nduring the production process which converts the submitted LaTeX manuscript into the journal’s final specifications \nfor publication. The template is based on the standard article.cls class file and supports almost all the functionality \nof that class file. \nIn the following sections we describe how to install the template package in your system and how to lay out \nyour code using this template to reproduce the typographical look of Wiley NJD journals. If you need support with \nit, please email latexsupport@wiley.com. \n2 Getting started \nThe WileyNJDv5.cls class file should run on any standard LaTeX installation. \nInstallation. First make sure you have at least MiKTeX 2.9 (21.2) or TeXLive 2021 installed on your computer \nor use the latest version of your LaTeX editor. Then make sure the WileyNJDv5 template.zip package file is \ndownloaded and extracted to a folder on your computer. The .zip file contains the following: \n– WileyNJDv5.cls \n– supporting style (.sty) files \n– bibliography style (.bst) files based on Wiley reference style \n– bibliography (.bib) files based on Wiley reference style sample format \nUsage. Once this template package is properly installed or copied to the local disk, use the class file WileyNJDv5.cls \nto create a LaTeX manuscript. Please make sure that your manuscript follows these guidelines. \n1 \n2.1 Font details \nIf you would like to use a font that simulates the one used in a specific NJD journal, please go to Wiley’s Author \nServices site where this LaTeX template is hosted and look up the font shown in the spreadsheet for that NJD \njournal. Alternatively you are free to use the fonts you already have installed in your system. The NJD fonts are as \nfollows: \n• Serif fonts – Stix, Times, Garamond, Minion Pro, Utopia, Century, Courier \n• Sanserif fonts – Lato, Helvetica, Myriad Pro, Arial, Univers \n2.2 How to use the defined fonts \nThe above listed fonts are available in the fonts folder located within the NJDv5 template folder. Please see \nscreenshot below. There is no need to install any fonts in your system. \nFont folder screenshot \n2.3 How to compile the LaTeX file \nBased on the LaTeX editor you use, please refer to the respective screenshot given below, and please use the option \nXeLaTeX for compilation as it supports all NJD fonts. If you are unable to use XeLaTeX, use the default compiler \nwith Times font. On completion of the compilation process, the PDF is available for preview. \nLaTeX editor – TeXworks \n2 \nLaTeX editor – TeXnicCenter \nLaTeX editor – TeXStudio \nLaTeX editor – WinEdt \n3 \n2.4 Usage of the \\documentclass command \nThe \\documentclass command is the first command in the template and defnes many options such as one-column \nformat, two-column format, fonts, and reference styles. \nYou can use a suitable font, reference style, and layout format based on the Wiley journal instructions. For \nexample: \n\\documentclass[AMS,Times1COL]{WileyNJDv5} \n- American Mathematical Society reference style \n- Times font and 1-column format \n\\documentclass[AMA,STIX2COL]{WileyNJDv5} \n- American Medical Association reference style \n- Stix font and 2-column format \nFor further font, layout and reference style options, refer to the Appendix. \n3 The Wiley NJDv5 LaTeX template \nThis template enables you to apply LaTeX coding to your manuscript that will ensure correct formatting of the \nfront matter, body text, and backmatter of the article. \nThe list of files in the template package includes LaTeX sample, class file, BibTeX style files, supporting files, \nand font package. The class file WileyNJDv5.cls supports all the NJD styles to simulate the journal layout as \nclosely as possible. \n3.1 Preparing your research article \nMany researchers prefer to use LaTeX to prepare their manuscript, but this can be difficult to navigate. In these \nguidelines, we have put together a comprehensive set of LaTeX resources to simplify the process. \nHere are some best practice principles to help avoid errors and ensure that the typesetting of your article runs as \nsmoothly as possible. If you are writing for a specific journal, please also check that journal’s Author Guidelines \non Wiley Online Library for any other journal-level formatting guidelines and instructions. \n• Please keep your LaTeX file simple – do not create a complicated preamble containing sophisticated LaTeX \nconstructions. Please keep your own macros to an absolute minimum. \n• In particular, please do not change global settings concerning spacings (such as \\parindent, \\parskip, \n\\textwidth, \\textheight, and \\pagebreak etc.) and do not introduce new labels or new environments \nfor defnitions, theorems etc. \n• As LaTeX is designed to make sensible spacing decisions by itself, please do not use vertical spacing commands, \nexcept in a few accepted (mostly mathematical) situations, such as \\bigskip, \\vskip24pt, and \n\\vspace*{24pt}. \n• Please do not use any custom fonts. \n• Please make sure that you convert special characters, including diacritical characters such as ¨ o, and ¨\na, ¨ \nu, into \nthe appropriate LaTeX codes, such as \\’’{a}, \\’’{o}, and \\’’{u}. \nMore detailed guidance on how to structure all elements of your manuscript using WileyNJDv5.cls is given in \nSections 4 and 5. \n4 \n3.2 Submission of your research article \nWhen it is time to submit your final files, please provide the LaTeX file along with any supporting files used, such \nas the bibliography/reference (.bib/.bbl) file and the PDF generated from the LaTeX file. Please try to provide your \narticle’s references in BibTeX format if possible because this will help during the conversion process if references \nneed to be reformatted to the journal’s reference style. Embedded references in the LaTeX file will require the \ntypesetter to carry out a manual process if the references are provided in a format that needs to be converted to the \njournal’s style. \nTo help with your submission: \n• please check for errors in your local compilation before uploading files to the submission system; \n• please fix any errors before trying to submit your manuscript, or it may fail to compile. \n4 The article header information \nAn example of article header information using WileyNJDv5.cls is shown below. \n\\documentclass[AMS,STIX1COL]{WileyNJDv5} \n\\articletype{Article Type}% \n\\received{00} \n\\revised{00} \n\\accepted{00} \n\\begin{document} \n\\title{Author guidelines for LaTeX manuscript preparation for \nWiley journals in New Journal Design (NJD)} \n\\author[1]{Author One} \n\\author[2,3]{Author Two} \n\\author[3]{Author Three} \n\\authormark{Author Name} \n\\titlemark{Author Guidelines} \n\\address[1]{\\orgdiv{Department Name}, \\orgname{Institution Name}, \n\\orgaddress{\\state{State Name}, \\country{Country Name}}} \n\\address[2]{\\orgdiv{Department Name}, \\orgname{Institution Name}, \n\\orgaddress{\\state{State Name}, \\country{Country Name}}} \n\\address[3]{\\orgdiv{Department Name}, \\orgname{Institution Name}, \n\\orgaddress{\\state{State Name}, \\country{Country Name}}} \n5 \n\\corres{<Corresponding author information>} \n\\presentaddress{<author present address information>} \n\\abstract[Abstract]{This document describes the use of \nthe LaTeX WileyNJDv5.cls class file for article preparation \nfor Wiley journals. } \n\\keywords{Keyword1, Keyword2, Keyword3, Keyword4} \n\\footnotetext{title footnote...} \n\\maketitle \n\\section{Introduction} \n. \n. \n. \nThe compiled output of this article header coding is shown below. \nReceived: Added at production\nRevised: Added at production\nAccepted: Added at production\nDOI: xxx/xxxx\nA R T I C L E T Y P E\nAuthor guidelines for LaTeX manuscript preparation for Wiley\njournals in New Journal Design (NJD)\nAuthor One1\nAuthor Two2,3\nAuthor Three3\n1Department Name, Institution Name, State Name,\nCountry Name\n2Department Name, Institution Name, State Name,\nCountry Name\n3Department Name, Institution Name, State Name,\nCountry Name\nCorrespondence\n<Corresponding author information>\nPresent address\n<author present address information>\nAbstract\nThis document describes the use of the LaTeX WileyNJD-v5.cls class ﬁle for article preparation for Wiley\njournals.\nK E Y W O R D S\nKeyword1, Keyword2, Keyword3, Keyword4\nExample of an article header information page output \n6 \n4.1 Remarks \n• Use \\authormark{} for running heads. \n• Use \\received{<received date>} \\revised{<revised date>} \\accepted{<accepted date>} \nfor history dates. Authors can input these dates as “00” when the manuscript is being prepared. \n5 The body of the article \nThe following sections describe how to code heading levels, equations, tables, fgures and other elements which \nmight be needed in the body of the article. Your manuscript should be structured by using the section, subsection \nand subsubsection environments. \nThe use of the LaTeX cross-reference system for sections, figures, tables, equations, etc., is encouraged (using \n\\ref{<name>} and \\label{<name>}). \n5.1 Heading level details \nThe template is defined by five levels of headings, and the coding for numbered headings is listed below. \nSection – use \\section{} \nSubsection – use \\subsection{} \nSubsubsection – use \\subsubsection{} \nParagraph – use \\paragraph{} \nSubparagraph – use \\subparagraph{} \n4\nA SECTION HEADING\n4.1\nA subsection heading\n4.1.1\nA subsubsection heading\n4.1.1.1\nA paragraph heading\n4.1.1.1.1\nA subparagraph heading.\nExamples of numbered section heading levels \nFor unnumbered headings, use an asterisk. \nSection – use \\section*{} \nSubsection – use \\subsection*{} \nSubsubsection – use \\subsubsection*{} \nParagraph – use \\paragraph*{} \nSubparagraph – use \\subparagraph*{} \n7 \nA SECTION HEADING\nA subsection heading\nA subsubsection heading\nA paragraph heading\nA subparagraph heading.\nExamples of unnumbered section heading levels \n5.2 Mathematics: equation coding details \nPlease ensure that all mathematics is correctly coded as maths in the LaTeX file, using e.g. $...$, $$...$$, \n\\[...\\] or the equation, align, eqnarray, and gather environments as appropriate, to enable it to \nbe correctly tagged for online display in the published article. This includes inline maths as well as displayed \nequations. \n5.2.1 Inline equation \nUse the standard $...$ environment to typeset inline equations, for example $a + b = c.$ to produce the \ninline equation a + b = c. \n5.2.2 Display equations \nUse the standard equation environment to typeset numbered display equations, for example: \n\\begin{equation} \n\\label{eq1} \na + b = c. \n\\end{equation} \na + b = c. \n(1) \nUnnumbered centered display equations can be created by using \\[...\\] or $$...$$ or the equation* \nenvironment, for example: \n$${W_{S}} = {\\sigma _L}(1 + \\cos \\theta ) \n= 2\\left( {\\sqrt {\\sigma _sˆd\\sigma _Lˆd} \n+ \\sqrt {\\sigma _sˆ{nd}\\sigma _Lˆ{nd}} } \\right)$$ \n\u0012q \nq\n\u0013 \nσdσd \nσndσnd\nWS = σL(1 + cos θ) = 2 \n+\ns\nL \ns\nL \nFor multi-line equations the align, gather, or eqnarray environment is recommended, for example: \n\\begin{align} \n|f(b)-f(a)| &=\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\label{eq2}\\\\ \n8 \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n&\\le \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\label{eq3} \n\\end{align} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \n(2) \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \n(3) \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n\\begin{gather} \n|f(b)-f(a)| =\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\label{eq4}\\\\ \n\\le \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\label{eq5} \n\\end{gather} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \n(4) \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \n(5) \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n|f(b)-f(a)| &=&\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\label{eq6}\\\\ \n&\\le& \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\label{eq7} \n\\end{eqnarray} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \n(6) \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \n(7) \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \nFor multi-line unnumbered equations the align*, gather*, or eqnarray* environment is recommended, \nfor example: \n\\begin{align*} \n|f(b)-f(a)| &=\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\\\ \n&\\le \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\end{align*} \n9 \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n\\begin{gather*} \n|f(b)-f(a)| =\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\\\ \n\\le \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\end{gather*} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n\\begin{eqnarray*} \n|f(b)-f(a)| &=&\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\\\ \n&\\le& \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\end{eqnarray*} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n5.3 Figure and table coding details \nWileyNJDv5.cls uses the graphicx/graphics package for handling figures.

If you just \nwant to write code within your document, the package provides the lstlisting environment; the output will be \nin Computer Modern typewriter font. Refer to the below example: \n\\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Descriptive caption text}, \nlabel=DescriptiveLabel,basicstyle=\\fontsize{8}{10}\\selectfont\\ttfamily] \nfor i:=maxint to 0 do \nbegin \n{ do nothing } \nend; \n16 \nWrite(’Case insensitive ’); \nWrite(’Pascal keywords.’); \n\\end{lstlisting} \nL I S T I N G 1\nDescriptive caption text\nfor i:=maxint to 0 do\nbegin\n{ do nothing }\nend;\nWrite(’Case insensitive ’);\nWrite(’Pascal keywords.’);\n6 Bibliography: Wiley reference styles \nThe following .bib format files are provided: \n• wileyNJD-WCMS.bib \n• wileyNJD-AMA.bib \n• wileyNJD-AMS.bib \n• wileyNJD-APA.bib \n• wileyNJD-APS.bib \n• wileyNJD-Chicago.bib \n• wileyNJD-Harvard.bib \n• wileyNJD-MLA.bib \n• wileyNJD-MPS.bib \n• wileyNJD-Vancouver.bib \nThe following bibliography styles are defined: \n• wileyNJD-WCMS.bst \n• wileyNJD-AMA.bst \n• wileyNJD-AMS.bst \n• wileyNJD-APA.bst \n• wileyNJD-APS.bst \n• wileyNJD-Chicago.bst \n• wileyNJD-Harvard.bst \n• wileyNJD-MLA.bst \n• wileyNJD-MPS.bst \n• wileyNJD-Vancouver.bst \nThese 10 BibTeX style (.bst) files are based on the 10 Wiley reference styles: WCMS1 (Wiley Chemistry–Material \nSciences), AMA (American Medical Association), AMS (American Mathematical Society), APA (American \n1WCMS reference style is based on American Chemical Society (ACS) reference style, which the earlier NJDv2 ACS-Lato and ACS-Stix \nLaTeX templates included. The Chemistry–Material Sciences reference style isn’t a new style, but the same style as used for journals in \nNJD.

Refer to the file wileyNJD-AMA.bib for details on how to provide author \nname, title, journal name, volume number, issue number, and page number information. \nReference citation commands such as \\cite, \\citet, and \\citep should be used to cross-cite in the body \ntext. Using one of the BibTeX style files provides correct formatting of references as per the Wiley Journals Style \nManual. The BibTeX style file identifies the elements of the reference and sets them in the correct style. If a \nBibTeX style file is not used, and references are included directly in the LaTeX file, when compiled they will be \ndisplayed exactly as provided. \nBelow is an example of how reference citations should be included in the text. This citation coding applies \nto all reference styles covered by the NJDv5 LaTeX template regardless of whether the journal’s citation style is \nnumbered or name-date style. \nText with reference citations included \\cite{Knupp1999,Kamm2000}. \nText with reference citations included (Kamm, 2000; Knupp, 1999). \nExamples of the 10 reference styles are given below. \n6.1 Example of coding details for Wiley Chemistry–Material Sciences (WCMS) reference style \n\\begin{thebibliography}{10} \n\\bibitem{Hirt1974} %%%% journal ref. \nC.

        "content": "Author guidelines for LaTeX manuscript preparation for \nWiley journals in New Journal Design (NJD) \n1 Introduction \nThis document offers step-by-step instructions to prepare LaTeX files using the Wiley NJDv5 LaTeX template. It \nhas been created to help authors prepare LaTeX manuscripts for journals formatted in New Journal Design (NJD), \nwhich is Wiley’s standard article layout. See the LaTeX page on Wiley’s Author Services site where this template \nis hosted for details about journals using NJD and their font, number of columns, and reference style for authors \nwho would like to simulate these using LaTeX. If the journal to which you want to submit your manuscript is not \nusing NJD, check with the Editorial Office of that journal to ask if they have their own journal-specific LaTeX \ntemplate. It is possible to use it for journals not using NJD even though it won’t look like the final typeset article. \nThis LaTeX template provides standard coding which Wiley’s vendors can successfully convert to XML for \ntypesetting purposes. (Please be aware that manuscript files will be converted by our typesetters into the journal’s \nfinal specifications for typeset articles, regardless of the reference, font and column number format selected in the \nLaTeX manuscript.) \nThis NJDv5 LaTeX template has been created to (1) provide proper guidance to simplify the process, (2) \nsimulate approximately how the article will look once published, and (3) reduce time and manual intervention \nduring the production process which converts the submitted LaTeX manuscript into the journal’s final specifications \nfor publication. The template is based on the standard article.cls class file and supports almost all the functionality \nof that class file. \nIn the following sections we describe how to install the template package in your system and how to lay out \nyour code using this template to reproduce the typographical look of Wiley NJD journals. If you need support with \nit, please email latexsupport@wiley.com. \n2 Getting started \nThe WileyNJDv5.cls class file should run on any standard LaTeX installation. \nInstallation. First make sure you have at least MiKTeX 2.9 (21.2) or TeXLive 2021 installed on your computer \nor use the latest version of your LaTeX editor. Then make sure the WileyNJDv5 template.zip package file is \ndownloaded and extracted to a folder on your computer. The .zip file contains the following: \n– WileyNJDv5.cls \n– supporting style (.sty) files \n– bibliography style (.bst) files based on Wiley reference style \n– bibliography (.bib) files based on Wiley reference style sample format \nUsage. Once this template package is properly installed or copied to the local disk, use the class file WileyNJDv5.cls \nto create a LaTeX manuscript. Please make sure that your manuscript follows these guidelines. \n1 \n2.1 Font details \nIf you would like to use a font that simulates the one used in a specific NJD journal, please go to Wiley’s Author \nServices site where this LaTeX template is hosted and look up the font shown in the spreadsheet for that NJD \njournal. Alternatively you are free to use the fonts you already have installed in your system. The NJD fonts are as \nfollows: \n• Serif fonts – Stix, Times, Garamond, Minion Pro, Utopia, Century, Courier \n• Sanserif fonts – Lato, Helvetica, Myriad Pro, Arial, Univers \n2.2 How to use the defined fonts \nThe above listed fonts are available in the fonts folder located within the NJDv5 template folder. Please see \nscreenshot below. There is no need to install any fonts in your system. \nFont folder screenshot \n2.3 How to compile the LaTeX file \nBased on the LaTeX editor you use, please refer to the respective screenshot given below, and please use the option \nXeLaTeX for compilation as it supports all NJD fonts. If you are unable to use XeLaTeX, use the default compiler \nwith Times font. On completion of the compilation process, the PDF is available for preview. \nLaTeX editor – TeXworks \n2 \nLaTeX editor – TeXnicCenter \nLaTeX editor – TeXStudio \nLaTeX editor – WinEdt \n3 \n2.4 Usage of the \\documentclass command \nThe \\documentclass command is the first command in the template and defnes many options such as one-column \nformat, two-column format, fonts, and reference styles. \nYou can use a suitable font, reference style, and layout format based on the Wiley journal instructions. For \nexample: \n\\documentclass[AMS,Times1COL]{WileyNJDv5} \n- American Mathematical Society reference style \n- Times font and 1-column format \n\\documentclass[AMA,STIX2COL]{WileyNJDv5} \n- American Medical Association reference style \n- Stix font and 2-column format \nFor further font, layout and reference style options, refer to the Appendix. \n3 The Wiley NJDv5 LaTeX template \nThis template enables you to apply LaTeX coding to your manuscript that will ensure correct formatting of the \nfront matter, body text, and backmatter of the article. \nThe list of files in the template package includes LaTeX sample, class file, BibTeX style files, supporting files, \nand font package. The class file WileyNJDv5.cls supports all the NJD styles to simulate the journal layout as \nclosely as possible. \n3.1 Preparing your research article \nMany researchers prefer to use LaTeX to prepare their manuscript, but this can be difficult to navigate. In these \nguidelines, we have put together a comprehensive set of LaTeX resources to simplify the process. \nHere are some best practice principles to help avoid errors and ensure that the typesetting of your article runs as \nsmoothly as possible. If you are writing for a specific journal, please also check that journal’s Author Guidelines \non Wiley Online Library for any other journal-level formatting guidelines and instructions. \n• Please keep your LaTeX file simple – do not create a complicated preamble containing sophisticated LaTeX \nconstructions. Please keep your own macros to an absolute minimum. \n• In particular, please do not change global settings concerning spacings (such as \\parindent, \\parskip, \n\\textwidth, \\textheight, and \\pagebreak etc.) and do not introduce new labels or new environments \nfor defnitions, theorems etc. \n• As LaTeX is designed to make sensible spacing decisions by itself, please do not use vertical spacing commands, \nexcept in a few accepted (mostly mathematical) situations, such as \\bigskip, \\vskip24pt, and \n\\vspace*{24pt}. \n• Please do not use any custom fonts. \n• Please make sure that you convert special characters, including diacritical characters such as ¨ o, and ¨\na, ¨ \nu, into \nthe appropriate LaTeX codes, such as \\’’{a}, \\’’{o}, and \\’’{u}. \nMore detailed guidance on how to structure all elements of your manuscript using WileyNJDv5.cls is given in \nSections 4 and 5. \n4 \n3.2 Submission of your research article \nWhen it is time to submit your final files, please provide the LaTeX file along with any supporting files used, such \nas the bibliography/reference (.bib/.bbl) file and the PDF generated from the LaTeX file. Please try to provide your \narticle’s references in BibTeX format if possible because this will help during the conversion process if references \nneed to be reformatted to the journal’s reference style. Embedded references in the LaTeX file will require the \ntypesetter to carry out a manual process if the references are provided in a format that needs to be converted to the \njournal’s style. \nTo help with your submission: \n• please check for errors in your local compilation before uploading files to the submission system; \n• please fix any errors before trying to submit your manuscript, or it may fail to compile. \n4 The article header information \nAn example of article header information using WileyNJDv5.cls is shown below. \n\\documentclass[AMS,STIX1COL]{WileyNJDv5} \n\\articletype{Article Type}% \n\\received{00} \n\\revised{00} \n\\accepted{00} \n\\begin{document} \n\\title{Author guidelines for LaTeX manuscript preparation for \nWiley journals in New Journal Design (NJD)} \n\\author[1]{Author One} \n\\author[2,3]{Author Two} \n\\author[3]{Author Three} \n\\authormark{Author Name} \n\\titlemark{Author Guidelines} \n\\address[1]{\\orgdiv{Department Name}, \\orgname{Institution Name}, \n\\orgaddress{\\state{State Name}, \\country{Country Name}}} \n\\address[2]{\\orgdiv{Department Name}, \\orgname{Institution Name}, \n\\orgaddress{\\state{State Name}, \\country{Country Name}}} \n\\address[3]{\\orgdiv{Department Name}, \\orgname{Institution Name}, \n\\orgaddress{\\state{State Name}, \\country{Country Name}}} \n5 \n\\corres{<Corresponding author information>} \n\\presentaddress{<author present address information>} \n\\abstract[Abstract]{This document describes the use of \nthe LaTeX WileyNJDv5.cls class file for article preparation \nfor Wiley journals. } \n\\keywords{Keyword1, Keyword2, Keyword3, Keyword4} \n\\footnotetext{title footnote...} \n\\maketitle \n\\section{Introduction} \n. \n. \n. \nThe compiled output of this article header coding is shown below. \nReceived: Added at production\nRevised: Added at production\nAccepted: Added at production\nDOI: xxx/xxxx\nA R T I C L E T Y P E\nAuthor guidelines for LaTeX manuscript preparation for Wiley\njournals in New Journal Design (NJD)\nAuthor One1\nAuthor Two2,3\nAuthor Three3\n1Department Name, Institution Name, State Name,\nCountry Name\n2Department Name, Institution Name, State Name,\nCountry Name\n3Department Name, Institution Name, State Name,\nCountry Name\nCorrespondence\n<Corresponding author information>\nPresent address\n<author present address information>\nAbstract\nThis document describes the use of the LaTeX WileyNJD-v5.cls class ﬁle for article preparation for Wiley\njournals.\nK E Y W O R D S\nKeyword1, Keyword2, Keyword3, Keyword4\nExample of an article header information page output \n6 \n4.1 Remarks \n• Use \\authormark{} for running heads. \n• Use \\received{<received date>} \\revised{<revised date>} \\accepted{<accepted date>} \nfor history dates. Authors can input these dates as “00” when the manuscript is being prepared. \n5 The body of the article \nThe following sections describe how to code heading levels, equations, tables, fgures and other elements which \nmight be needed in the body of the article. Your manuscript should be structured by using the section, subsection \nand subsubsection environments. \nThe use of the LaTeX cross-reference system for sections, figures, tables, equations, etc., is encouraged (using \n\\ref{<name>} and \\label{<name>}). \n5.1 Heading level details \nThe template is defined by five levels of headings, and the coding for numbered headings is listed below. \nSection – use \\section{} \nSubsection – use \\subsection{} \nSubsubsection – use \\subsubsection{} \nParagraph – use \\paragraph{} \nSubparagraph – use \\subparagraph{} \n4\nA SECTION HEADING\n4.1\nA subsection heading\n4.1.1\nA subsubsection heading\n4.1.1.1\nA paragraph heading\n4.1.1.1.1\nA subparagraph heading.\nExamples of numbered section heading levels \nFor unnumbered headings, use an asterisk. \nSection – use \\section*{} \nSubsection – use \\subsection*{} \nSubsubsection – use \\subsubsection*{} \nParagraph – use \\paragraph*{} \nSubparagraph – use \\subparagraph*{} \n7 \nA SECTION HEADING\nA subsection heading\nA subsubsection heading\nA paragraph heading\nA subparagraph heading.\nExamples of unnumbered section heading levels \n5.2 Mathematics: equation coding details \nPlease ensure that all mathematics is correctly coded as maths in the LaTeX file, using e.g. $...$, $$...$$, \n\\[...\\] or the equation, align, eqnarray, and gather environments as appropriate, to enable it to \nbe correctly tagged for online display in the published article. This includes inline maths as well as displayed \nequations. \n5.2.1 Inline equation \nUse the standard $...$ environment to typeset inline equations, for example $a + b = c.$ to produce the \ninline equation a + b = c. \n5.2.2 Display equations \nUse the standard equation environment to typeset numbered display equations, for example: \n\\begin{equation} \n\\label{eq1} \na + b = c. \n\\end{equation} \na + b = c. \n(1) \nUnnumbered centered display equations can be created by using \\[...\\] or $$...$$ or the equation* \nenvironment, for example: \n$${W_{S}} = {\\sigma _L}(1 + \\cos \\theta ) \n= 2\\left( {\\sqrt {\\sigma _sˆd\\sigma _Lˆd} \n+ \\sqrt {\\sigma _sˆ{nd}\\sigma _Lˆ{nd}} } \\right)$$ \n\u0012q \nq\n\u0013 \nσdσd \nσndσnd\nWS = σL(1 + cos θ) = 2 \n+\ns\nL \ns\nL \nFor multi-line equations the align, gather, or eqnarray environment is recommended, for example: \n\\begin{align} \n|f(b)-f(a)| &=\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\label{eq2}\\\\ \n8 \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n&\\le \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\label{eq3} \n\\end{align} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \n(2) \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \n(3) \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n\\begin{gather} \n|f(b)-f(a)| =\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\label{eq4}\\\\ \n\\le \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\label{eq5} \n\\end{gather} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \n(4) \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \n(5) \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n\\begin{eqnarray} \n|f(b)-f(a)| &=&\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\label{eq6}\\\\ \n&\\le& \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\label{eq7} \n\\end{eqnarray} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \n(6) \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \n(7) \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \nFor multi-line unnumbered equations the align*, gather*, or eqnarray* environment is recommended, \nfor example: \n\\begin{align*} \n|f(b)-f(a)| &=\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\\\ \n&\\le \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\end{align*} \n9 \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n\\begin{gather*} \n|f(b)-f(a)| =\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\\\ \n\\le \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\end{gather*} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n\\begin{eqnarray*} \n|f(b)-f(a)| &=&\\left|\\int_aˆb f’(x)\\,{\\rm d}x\\right| \n\\le \\int_aˆb |f’(x)|\\,{\\rm d}x\\\\ \n&\\le& \\int_aˆb \\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|\\,{\\rm d}x \n=(b-a)\\max_{a\\le t\\le b}|f’(t)|. \n\\end{eqnarray*} \nZ b \nZ b \n|f(b) − f(a)| = \nf ′ (x) dx ≤\n|f ′ (x)| dx \na\na\nZ b \n≤ \nmax |f ′ (t)| dx = (b − a) max |f ′ (t)|. \na a≤t≤b\na≤t≤b \n5.3 Figure and table coding details \nWileyNJDv5.cls uses the graphicx/graphics package for handling figures. The standard coding for a figure set in \none column is shown below: \n\\begin{figure} \n\\centering \n\\includegraphics{filename.eps} \n\\caption{This is the sample figure caption.} \n\\label{fig1} \n\\end{figure} \n10 \nempty.pdf \nF I G U R E 1 This is the sample figure caption. \nAlternatively, if the journal page has two columns, this sample figure coding forces the figure across both columns: \n\\begin{figure*}[!t] \n\\centerline{\\includegraphics{filename.eps}} \n\\caption{This is the sample figure caption.} \n\\label{fig2} \n\\end{figure*} \nA sample figure citation is: (Figures˜\\ref{fig1} and˜\\ref{fig2}). When compiled the output will \nshow as Figures 1 and 2. \nAn example of standard coding for a table is shown below. (Note that the specific example given is for a table \nbeing placed on a page using a two-column layout for body text.) The final layout of tables in finalized typeset \narticles will depend on journal specifications. \n\\begin{table*}% \n\\caption{This is sample table caption.\\label{tab1}} \n\\begin{tabular*}{\\textwidth}{@{\\extracolsep\\fill}lllll@{}}\\toprule \n&\\multicolumn{2}{@{}c@{}}{\\textbf{Spanned heading$ˆ{\\tnote{\\bf a}}$}} \n& \\multicolumn{2}{@{}c@{}}{\\textbf{Spanned heading$ˆ{\\tnote{\\bf b}}$}} \\\\ \n\\cmidrule{2-3}\\cmidrule{4-5} \n\\textbf{Col1 head} & \\textbf{Col2 head} & \\textbf{Col3 head} \n& \\multicolumn{1}{@{}l@{}}{\\textbf{Col4 head}} & \\textbf{Col5 head} \n\\\\ \n\\midrule \nCol1 text & Col2 text & Col3 text & 12.34 & Col5 text\\tnote{1} \n\\\\ \nCol1 text & Col2 text & Col3 text & 1.62 & Col5 text\\tnote{2} \n\\\\ \nCol1 text & Col2 text & Col3 text & 51.809 & Col5 text \n\\\\ \n\\bottomrule \n\\end{tabular*} \n\\begin{tablenotes} \n\\item[] Example for unnumbered table footnote text. \n\\item[$ˆ{\\rm a}$] Example for a f\\kern.01ptirst numbered table footnote. \n\\item[$ˆ{\\rm b}$] Example for a second numbered table footnote. \n\\end{tablenotes} \n\\end{table*} \n11 \nT A B L E 1\nThis is sample table caption.\nSpanned headinga\nSpanned headingb\nCol1 head\nCol2 head\nCol3 head\nCol4 head\nCol5 head\nCol1 text\nCol2 text\nCol3 text\n12.34\nCol5 text1\nCol1 text\nCol2 text\nCol3 text\n1.62\nCol5 text2\nCol1 text\nCol2 text\nCol3 text\n51.809\nCol5 text\nExample for unnumbered table footnote text.\naExample for a ﬁrst numbered table footnote.\nbExample for a second numbered table footnote.\n5.4 Example of coding for display quotes/block quotes \nIf a display quote or a block quote appears in your manuscript, then use the coding given below. \n\\begin{quote} \nThis is an example for quote text. \n\\rightline{---Quote source\\hspace*{20pt}} \n\\end{quote} \nThe output of this coding is shown below: \nThis is an example for quote text. \n—Quote source \n5.5 Examples of boxes with or without a heading \nFor boxes with or without a heading, the coding details are given below. \n\\begin{boxwithhead} \n{BOX 1 This is sample for box heading} \n{This is sample for box text. } \n\\end{boxwithhead} \nBOX 1 This is sample for box heading \nThis is sample for box text. \n\\begin{boxtext}% \n{This is sample for box text. } \n\\end{boxtext} \nThis is sample for box text. \n12 \n5.6 List items \n5.6.1 Enumerate list styles \n\\begin{enumerate}[1.] \n\\item list entry \n\\item list entry \n\\end{enumerate} \n\\begin{enumerate}[(1)] \n\\item list entry \n\\item list entry \n\\end{enumerate} \n\\begin{enumerate}[I.] \n\\item list entry \n\\item list entry \n\\end{enumerate} \n\\begin{enumerate}[i.] \n\\item list entry \n\\item list entry \n\\end{enumerate} \n\\begin{enumerate}[(a)] \n\\item list entry \n\\item list entry \n\\end{enumerate} \n1. list entry \n2. list entry \n(1) list entry \n(2) list entry \nI. list entry \nII. list entry \ni. list entry \nii. list entry \n(a) list entry \n(b) list entry \n5.6.2 Bullet list styles \n\\begin{itemize} \n\\item bullet list entry \n13 \n\\item bullet list entry \n\\end{itemize} \n• bullet list entry \n• bullet list entry \n5.6.3 Description list \n\\begin{description} \n\\item[Step 1] description text. \n\\item[Step 2] description text. \n\\end{description} \nStep 1 description text. \nStep 2 description text. \n5.7 Examples of theorem type environments and proofs \nYou may use the claim, corollary, definition, example, lemma, proposition, theorem, and \nremark environments: \n\\begin{claim} \nClaim text goes here. \n\\end{claim} \n\\begin{corollary}[Optional Corollary subhead] \n\\label{cor1} \nCorollary text goes here. \n\\end{corollary} \n\\begin{definition}[Optional Definition subhead] \n\\label{def1} \nDefinition text goes here. \n\\end{definition} \n\\begin{example}[Optional Example subhead] \n\\label{ex1} \nExample text goes here. \n\\end{example} \n\\begin{lemma}[Optional Lemma subhead] \n\\label{lem1} \nLemma text goes here. \n\\end{lemma} \n\\begin{proposition}[Optional Proposition subhead] \n\\label{prop1} \n14 \nProposition text goes here. \n\\end{proposition} \n\\begin{theorem}[Optional Theorem subhead] \n\\label{thm1} \nTheorem text goes here. \n\\end{theorem} \n\\begin{remark} \n\\label{rem1} \nRemark text goes here. \n\\end{remark} \nClaim 1.

If you just \nwant to write code within your document, the package provides the lstlisting environment; the output will be \nin Computer Modern typewriter font. Refer to the below example: \n\\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Descriptive caption text}, \nlabel=DescriptiveLabel,basicstyle=\\fontsize{8}{10}\\selectfont\\ttfamily] \nfor i:=maxint to 0 do \nbegin \n{ do nothing } \nend; \n16 \nWrite(’Case insensitive ’); \nWrite(’Pascal keywords.’); \n\\end{lstlisting} \nL I S T I N G 1\nDescriptive caption text\nfor i:=maxint to 0 do\nbegin\n{ do nothing }\nend;\nWrite(’Case insensitive ’);\nWrite(’Pascal keywords.’);\n6 Bibliography: Wiley reference styles \nThe following .bib format files are provided: \n• wileyNJD-WCMS.bib \n• wileyNJD-AMA.bib \n• wileyNJD-AMS.bib \n• wileyNJD-APA.bib \n• wileyNJD-APS.bib \n• wileyNJD-Chicago.bib \n• wileyNJD-Harvard.bib \n• wileyNJD-MLA.bib \n• wileyNJD-MPS.bib \n• wileyNJD-Vancouver.bib \nThe following bibliography styles are defined: \n• wileyNJD-WCMS.bst \n• wileyNJD-AMA.bst \n• wileyNJD-AMS.bst \n• wileyNJD-APA.bst \n• wileyNJD-APS.bst \n• wileyNJD-Chicago.bst \n• wileyNJD-Harvard.bst \n• wileyNJD-MLA.bst \n• wileyNJD-MPS.bst \n• wileyNJD-Vancouver.bst \nThese 10 BibTeX style (.bst) files are based on the 10 Wiley reference styles: WCMS1 (Wiley Chemistry–Material \nSciences), AMA (American Medical Association), AMS (American Mathematical Society), APA (American \n1WCMS reference style is based on American Chemical Society (ACS) reference style, which the earlier NJDv2 ACS-Lato and ACS-Stix \nLaTeX templates included.

Refer to the file wileyNJD-AMA.bib for details on how to provide author \nname, title, journal name, volume number, issue number, and page number information. \nReference citation commands such as \\cite, \\citet, and \\citep should be used to cross-cite in the body \ntext. Using one of the BibTeX style files provides correct formatting of references as per the Wiley Journals Style \nManual. The BibTeX style file identifies the elements of the reference and sets them in the correct style. If a \nBibTeX style file is not used, and references are included directly in the LaTeX file, when compiled they will be \ndisplayed exactly as provided. \nBelow is an example of how reference citations should be included in the text.

        "content": "Please describe your innovative idea. \nDie Makiol Wiederkehr AG (MW) ist ein etabliertes Holzbau- und \nBrandschutzingenieurbüro. Der interne Wissensaustausch erfolgte bislang vor allem \ndurch direkte Gespräche. Mit 38 Mitarbeitenden, Teilzeitpensen und mehreren \nGenerationen wird der Wissenserhalt zunehmend zur Herausforderung. Zentrales \nWissen liegt auf dem Firmenserver in Form von PDF-Dokumenten, Bildern, Plänen und \nTabellen. Jährlich werden rund 1000 Arbeitsstunden für das konventionelle Suchen nach \nInformationen per Windows Explorer aufgewendet – Zeit, die durch eine KI-gestützte \nLösung deutlich reduziert werden kann. Um Datenschutz zu gewährleisten und die \nQualität sowie Geschwindigkeit der Suchergebnisse zu erhöhen, wird ein \nmassgeschneidertes, lokales KI-Modell entwickelt. Hierfür kommen agentic-AI-RAG-\nMethoden zum Einsatz, die eine bestmögliche Beantwortung von Nutzerfragen und \nflexible Anpassungen an zukünftige Anforderungen ermöglichen. Mit der RAG-Methode \n(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) wird der gesamte Firmendatensatz effizient \nvektorisiert, um einem lokalen LCM (Large Concept Model) gemeinsam mit der \nNutzerfrage (Prompt) kontextuelles Wissen aus dem Firmendatensatz zu übermitteln. Im \nUnterschied zu klassischen LLMs arbeitet das LCM auf konzeptueller Ebene und kann \nmultimodale Datensätze – wie Texte, Bilder, Pläne und Tabellen – gemeinsam \nverarbeiten. Dadurch wird die  Einbindung verschiedenster Dateiformate ermöglicht und \ndas Risiko von Halluzinationen, wie es bei herkömmlichen LLMs besteht,  weiter \nminimiert und besser kontrollierbar. Dies gewährleistet präzise und nachvollziehbare \nAntworten, die auf dem Firmenwissen aufbauen.  Zudem kann der RAG-Datensatz \nkontinuierlich mit wachsendem Firmenwissen erweitert werden. Die Integration \nzusätzlicher, für den Nutzer unsichtbarer Agenten (agentic RAG) steigert Präzision, \nEffizienz und Flexibilität des Systems weiter. So wird der firmeninterne Wissenserhalt \nund -austausch durch modernste KI-Methoden nachhaltig unterstützt. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow does it differ from existing solutions or products? \nDie vorgeschlagene KI-Lösung hebt sich in mehreren wesentlichen Punkten deutlich \nvom Stand der Technik und bestehenden Produkten ab und zeichnet sich insbesondere \ndurch folgende innovative Ansätze aus: \n1.    Datensicherheit  \nBestehende Lösungen: Cloud-basierte Produkte (z.B. Microsoft Copilot, Google \nGemini) bergen Risiken durch externe Datenverarbeitung. \nUnser innovativer Ansatz: Vollständig on-premise betriebene Lösung, sodass Daten \nintern bleiben und höchste Datenschutzstandards gewährleistet sind. \n2.    RAG und Agentic Processing  \nBestehende Lösungen: Meist einfache Volltextsuche oder generische KI-Assistenten, \nohne tiefgehende Kontextanalyse oder eigenständige Bearbeitung komplexer Prozesse. \n Unser innovativer Ansatz: Kombination von Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mit \nagentenbasierten Methoden. Dies ermöglicht der KI eigenständiges Extrahieren \nrelevanter Informationen und eine proaktive Unterstützung komplexer Aufgaben – eine \nMethode, die kommerziell bislang kaum realisiert wurde. \n3.    Large Concept Models (LCMs)  \nBestehende Lösungen: Verwendung von Large Language Models (LLMs), meist \nwortbasiert mit begrenzter Multimodalität (Text, Bilder, Tabellen). \nUnser innovativer Ansatz: Einsatz von Large Concept Models (LCMs), welche \nInformationen auf konzeptioneller Ebene verarbeiten. Dadurch verbessert sich das \nKontextverständnis erheblich, Fehlinterpretationen („Halluzinationen“) werden reduziert \nund multimodale Informationsverarbeitung ermöglicht. LCMs stellen derzeit eine \ntechnologische Neuheit dar und sind kommerziell noch nicht etabliert. \n4.    Flexibilität und Anpassbarkeit  \n Bestehende Lösungen: Häufig starre Systeme, schwer an individuelle Prozesse oder \nneue Anforderungen adaptierbar. \nUnser innovativer Ansatz: Untersuchung einer modularen, kontinuierlich lernenden KI-\nLösung, die flexibel auf veränderte Bedürfnisse, neue Datenquellen und Arbeitsprozesse \nreagieren kann. Dies sichert langfristige Anpassbarkeit und nachhaltige Nutzbarkeit. \n \n \n \n \nHas your company already collaborated with research partners? \nNO \nWhat is the research partners contribution? \nDas Laboratory for Web Science (LWS) der Fernfachhochschule Schweiz (FFHS) bringt \nfolgende Leistungen und Kompetenzen in die Machbarkeitsstudie ein: \n• \nExpertenwissen und methodische Kompetenz: \nDas LWS verfügt über ausgewiesene Expertise in den Bereichen Künstliche \nIntelligenz, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models \n(LLMs), Large Concept Models (LCMs) und Agentic Processing. Diese \nKompetenzen werden gezielt eingesetzt, um die technische Machbarkeit \ninnovativer KI-Lösungen zu bewerten und methodisch zu begleiten. \n• \nEvaluierung und Prototyping: \nDas LWS führt experimentelle Analysen und prototypische Tests mit \nausgewählten Unternehmensdaten durch. Ziel ist es, die Leistungsfähigkeit und \nden potenziellen Nutzen der geplanten KI-Lösung unter realen Bedingungen zu \nvalidieren. Dabei werden sowohl strukturierte als auch unstrukturierte und \nmultimodale Daten (z.B. Texte, Bilder, Tabellen) berücksichtigt, um \npraxisrelevante Anforderungen abzudecken. \n• \nMachbarkeitsanalyse hinsichtlich Infrastruktur und Architektur: \nEin zentraler Beitrag des LWS ist die Bewertung der technischen und \ninfrastrukturellen Voraussetzungen für die Entwicklung, Implementierung und \nden nachhaltigen Betrieb einer maßgeschneiderten, firmeninternen KI-Lösung. \nDazu gehören die Analyse bestehender IT-Landschaften, \nDatenschutzanforderungen und die Integration neuer KI-Technologien in \nbestehende Prozesse. \n• \nEmpfehlungen und Handlungsempfehlungen: \nAuf Basis der gewonnenen Erkenntnisse erstellt das LWS eine fundierte \nEinschätzung zur Umsetzbarkeit und Wirtschaftlichkeit der geplanten KI-Lösung. \nEs werden konkrete Empfehlungen formuliert, wie die Einführung einer \nindividuellen KI-Lösung technisch und organisatorisch sinnvoll realisiert werden \nkann. Darüber hinaus werden strategische Hinweise zur Weiterentwicklung und \nSkalierbarkeit gegeben, um einen nachhaltigen Nutzen für das Unternehmen \nsicherzustellen. \n \n \n \n \nDescribe the additional value provided by the research partner for your company. \nDas LWS bringt im Rahmen der Machbarkeitsstudie einen klaren Mehrwert für die Makiol \nWiederkehr AG durch folgende Aspekte: \n• \nRisiko- und Investitionsreduktion: \nDie Studie erlaubt dem Unternehmen, vor grösseren Investitionen fundiert \nabzuschätzen, ob eine individuell entwickelte KI-Lösung tatsächlich technisch \nund wirtschaftlich umsetzbar ist. \n• \nEntscheidungsgrundlage für Management: \nDie wissenschaftlich fundierte und unabhängige Bewertung durch den \nForschungspartner liefert eine klare Entscheidungsgrundlage, ob und wie das \nUnternehmen weiter in Richtung KI-basierter Wissensmanagement-Lösungen \ninvestieren sollte. \n• \nZugang zu aktuellem Forschungswissen: \nDurch die Zusammenarbeit erhält das Unternehmen frühzeitig Zugriff auf aktuelle \nForschungsergebnisse und Erkenntnisse im Bereich KI, insbesondere in den \nThemenfeldern RAG, Agentic Processing, Large Language Models und Large \nConcept Models. \n• \nIdentifikation von Optimierungspotenzialen: \nDie Machbarkeitsstudie identifiziert gezielt Potenziale für Effizienzgewinne, \nwelche durch eine spezifische KI-Lösung erreicht werden könnten, und bewertet \ndiese Potenziale objektiv und nachvollziehbar. \n• \nZukunftsorientierung und Innovationsfähigkeit: \nDie Studie unterstützt das Unternehmen darin, den nächsten \nDigitalisierungsschritt strategisch zu planen und so langfristig wettbewerbsfähig \nzu bleiben. \n \n \n",

Die Inhalte sind mit Vorsicht zu \nbetrachten, jedoch sind gewisse Inhalte hilfreich. Zum Beispiel für das Verfassen eines Textes. In unserem Fall müsste \njemand die aktuellen Richtlinien, Stand-der-Technik-Papiere, Materialsammlungen ect. ständig à jour halten, um die \nGrundlagen für unsere interne KI zu gewährleisten. Ist die interne KI dann hilfreicher als z.B. Informationen von \nChatGPT? \nWie kann ich Korrektheit der Antwort überprüfen? Wie bleiben Informationen und Inhalte nur bei MW. Vorschlag 1 auf \nSuche von KI intern und Vorschlag 2 von Vorschlag von Internet. Wie lange dauert eine Suche? Vorgabe von max. \nZeitdauer sollte möglich sein. \nJe nach Projektleiter sehr unterschiedliche Art, Wissen zu dokumentieren. \nDass die interne Kommunikation und der Austausch im Team noch weiter abnimmt. Dass der Aufwand gross ist und \nniemand die System Pflege machen kann. \nGewährleisten, dass Informationen nur intern bleiben \nKosten-Nutzenverhältnis \nSicherheit \nBedenken, dass die KI einfach nur alle Texte sammelt, jedoch nicht die für Projektblätter wichtigen Informationen \nherauskristallisiert. Auch ob die Zusammenfassung korrekt ist und Sinn macht. Und ob die KI die für ein Projektblatt \n\"wichtigen\" Bausteine herausfiltern kann um ein Dokument zu entwerfen, welches die Informationen enthält, welche \nfür ein Referenzblatt nötig sind. \nWie kann man sicherstellen, dass die Antwort nicht als generischer Text ausgegeben wird, falls man eine Text frage \nstelle. Wie kann man das Tool so programieren, dass die entsprechen Grundlagen als markierte Stelle im Dokument \nals Pop-Up neben der Frage & Antwort Fenster erscheint. \nProbleme sehe ich das man es \"einfach\" braucht aber halt doch nicht einfach ist. weil wen man zwei Wörter hat zum \nsuchen hat kann es sein das dan 400 Dokumente aufpoppen und zu viele Antworten hat. \nkeine Antwort \ndie Angaben sollten nur intern bleiben \nNoch keine Vorstellung \nSind die Vorgänge der Administration und der Ingenieurarbeiten dieselben? Messerli-Programme seit 2016 in \nGebrauch. Suchvorgänge sehr oft über Messerli-Programme um im MW-Laufwerk die Unterlagen zu finden. Alles war \nvor 2016 erstellt wurde, ist schwieriger zu finden was Administration anbelangt. Archivliste Projekte beste Suchliste \nfür Projekte. Zur Frage wie viel Zeit pro Monat aufgewendet wird, gilt nur, wenn die Suche in den Messerli-Programmen \nnicht hinzugerechnet wird. Ansonsten ist die Zeitdauer der Suche pro Monat höher.  \nWer trainiert den Bot? Zeitaufwand evtl. höher als Entwicklung? \nDatenschutz, Vertrauenswürdiger Partner?, sehr Nützlich wenn es funktioniert.  \nDaten werden mit der ganzen Welt geteilt \nich denke einiges an Inforamtion ist auch in unserm Email Ordnern uhd kommt gar nie in dei Ordnerstruktur  \nEin Chatbot könnte ein Hilfreiches Tool für den Arbeitsalltag darstellen. \nEs führt dazu, dass noch weniger miteinander kommuniziert wird... \nInternes Know-How soll unbedingt intern bleiben und nicht nach aussen getragen werden \nGibt es dazu nicht bereits Softwares und Chatbots die man herunterladen und nutzen kann oder gar mit Zugriffs \nBerechtigung über Internet nutzen kann? \nIch würde mir überlegen grösser zu denken und nicht \"Feuer zu löschen\". \nWie können Normenäderungen von der KI erkennt werden? Wie wird die Inhaltliche Richtigkeit und Qualität \nüberprüft?  \nFiltert der Chatbot dann auch die Entwürfe und Archiv in einem Projekt durch? Sprich hat man dann nicht aktuelle \n(evtl. falsche) Sachen drin? Muss vom Anwender geprüft werden \nSicherheit, Updates, Ansprechperson \nKeine \nHoffentlich generiert diese Funktion keine Ablage Aufgaben. \nQuellen wichtig! ggf. Ansprechpersonen mit angeben. Wie sammeln wir intern wissen am besten und wie arbeiten wir \nes dann auf. Es ist genau so wichtig das interne Wissen gut aufzuarbeiten und dann zur Verfügung zu stellen, wie es \nauffindbar zu machen. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

        "content": " \nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks for Metal \nAdditive Manufacturing: A Comprehensive \nLiterature Review \nIntroduction \nPhysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach in scientific \nmachine learning, particularly for addressing complex multiphysics problems in metal additive \nmanufacturing (AM) [1][2]. These networks integrate governing physical laws directly into the neural \nnetwork architecture through the loss function, enabling accurate predictions with reduced data \nrequirements compared to purely data-driven approaches [3][4]. This review focuses on PINN applications \nin Direct Energy Deposition (DED) processes, including Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) and Laser \nEngineered Net Shaping (LENS), as well as Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) technologies such as Selective Laser \nMelting (SLM) and Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). \nDirect Energy Deposition (DED) Applications \nThermal Stress Prediction in Laser Metal Deposition \nRecent breakthrough research by Sharma and Guo presents the first comprehensive application of PINNs \nfor predicting thermal stress evolution in laser metal deposition processes [1]. Their thermoelastic PINN \nframework incorporates governing physical laws into deep neural networks to predict both temperature \nand thermal stress evolution during the LMD process [1]. The study demonstrates that PINNs can serve as \nan alternative to conventional finite element analysis methods, offering significant computational \nadvantages for parametric studies [1]. \nThe researchers developed a dual-network architecture consisting of separate networks for temperature \nand stress field predictions [1]. The stress-displacement network outputs three displacement components \nand six stress tensor components, avoiding additional calculations and improving computational \nefficiency [1]. Their approach integrates the energy equation, strain-displacement relations, stress-strain \nconstitutive laws, and equilibrium equations directly into the loss function [1]. \nKey findings include the ability to predict thermal stress evolution without requiring labeled training data, \nwith the thermoelastic PINN model serving as an effective soft sensor for real-time predictions [1]. When \nsupplemented with small simulation datasets, the model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and training \nefficiency [1]. The transferability capability allows fast predictions for different parameter sets in \napproximately 3 minutes, compared to hours required by physics-based simulation models [1]. \nTemperature Field Prediction in DED Processes \nXie et al. developed a physics-informed neural network specifically for three-dimensional temperature \nfield prediction during DED processes [5]. Their hybrid physical/data-driven approach incorporates partial \ndifferential equations for heat conduction, utilizing laser power, scanning speed, time, and spatial \ncoordinates as inputs [6]. The model successfully achieved high-accuracy predictions with smaller datasets \ncompared to purely data-driven models [6]. \nSajadi's recent thesis work presents a comprehensive PINN framework for predicting 2D temperature \nfields in metal additive manufacturing, with specific applications to Direct Laser Deposition (DLD) and \nDirected Energy Deposition processes [7]. The framework incorporates AM-specific heat input \ncharacteristics and custom loss functions to enforce heat transfer equations [7]. The study demonstrates \nsuperior performance compared to traditional neural networks through both offline and online learning \nmethodologies [7]. \nMulti-Physics Modeling and Melt Pool Dynamics \nSharma et al. introduced a physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting argon gas-driven \nmelt pool dynamics in metal AM [8]. Their PINN framework integrates neural networks with governing \npartial differential equations, initial conditions, and boundary conditions, effectively avoiding the need to \nsolve highly non-linear Navier-Stokes equations numerically [8]. The data-efficient PINN model \nincorporates governing PDEs as soft penalties, significantly reducing computational costs while \nmaintaining accuracy [8]. \nThe study by Zhu et al. applied PINNs to predict domain temperature and melt pool dynamics, comparing \nlearning efficiency between \"hard\" and \"soft\" boundary condition implementations [9]. Their results \ndemonstrated that PINN models could predict thermal history, melt pool velocity, and cooling rates with \nrelatively less training data compared to conventional approaches [9]. \nPowder Bed Fusion (PBF) Applications \nTransfer Learning-Enhanced PINNs for SLM \nA groundbreaking development in PBF applications is the Transfer Learning-Enhanced Physics-Informed \nNeural Network (TLE-PINN) for predicting melt pool morphology in Selective Laser Melting [10][11]. This \napproach combines physical constraints with machine learning, incorporating heat transfer equations and \nboundary conditions directly into the neural network's loss function [10]. The TLE-PINN framework fine-\ntunes models using high-fidelity data while freezing earlier network parameters, resulting in more \nefficient training and computational scalability [10]. \nThe method demonstrates superior accuracy and faster training times compared to traditional numerical \nsimulations, with significant potential for industrial applications requiring real-time process control \n[10][12]. The physics-informed approach ensures that predictions accurately represent melt pool \nmorphology while maintaining computational efficiency [11]. \nThermal Analysis in LPBF Processes \nResearch by Ghungrad et al. demonstrates the effectiveness of physics-informed deep learning models \ncompared to purely data-driven LSTM models in SLM processes for thermal prediction [13]. Their PIDL \nmodel showed superior performance in terms of both computational time and accuracy, even with limited \ntraining data [13]. Further enhancements through architecture-driven PIDL (APIDL) have been developed \nto predict thermal history in L-PBF processes with improved efficiency [13]. \nSeveral studies have explored PINN applications for thermal analysis in LPBF processes, demonstrating \nthat well-trained PINN models can serve as accurate and computationally efficient replacements for finite \nelement thermal analysis [14][15]. These models incorporate conservation of energy laws, initial conditions, \nand boundary conditions for physical loss calculation, enabling accurate temperature field predictions [14]. \nMulti-Track and Parametric Solutions \nRecent advances include operator learning approaches using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) \ncombined with PINNs for predicting three-dimensional temperature distributions during melting and \nconsolidation in LPBF [16]. These methods obtain parametric solutions for both single-track and multi-\ntrack scenarios with respect to tool paths [16]. Sequential PINN approaches have been proposed to \nefficiently manage the increased training complexity inherent in multi-track scenarios [16]. \nPhysics-Informed Loss Function Implementation \nHeat Transfer Equations Integration \nThe core advantage of PINNs lies in their incorporation of governing physical equations directly into the \nloss function [3][17]. For AM applications, this typically involves the heat conduction equation, boundary \nconditions for convection and radiation, and initial temperature conditions [3]. The physics-informed loss \nfunction is formulated as: \nThe total loss function combines data loss, PDE residual loss, boundary condition loss, and initial \ncondition loss [3][18]. The PDE residual term ensures that the neural network solution satisfies the \ngoverning heat transfer equations at collocation points throughout the computational domain [3]. \nBoundary condition terms enforce realistic heat exchange mechanisms including convection, radiation, \nand laser heat input [3]. \nAdvanced Loss Function Formulations \nRecent developments include improved physics-informed loss functions with variance-based \nregularization terms to address localized outliers and improve solution quality in regions with sharp \ngradients [17]. These enhanced formulations combine mean and standard deviation of error metrics, \nensuring more uniform error distribution and reducing the impact of localized high-error regions [17]. \nOptimal loss function design for PINNs has been explored, with weighted loss functions respecting \ncausality and new formulations based on generalized functions [19]. These approaches eliminate the need \nto tune scaling coefficients for boundary and initial condition terms by representing the loss function as a \nsingle term associated with differential equations [19]. \nReal-Time and Online Learning Applications \nPhysics-Informed Online Learning Framework \nThe first physics-informed online learning framework specifically designed for temperature prediction in \nmetal AM has been introduced by Sajadi et al. [20][21]. This approach integrates PINNs with transfer \nlearning and online learning capabilities to address real-time thermal modeling challenges [20]. The \nframework demonstrates real-time adaptability, faster computation times, continuous learning \ncapabilities, and effective utilization of process data [20][21]. \nThe online learning phase employs Synaptic Intelligence and adaptive learning rates to maintain \npreviously acquired knowledge while adapting to new data from different AM processes [20]. This enables \ndynamic weight updates through online gradient descent in response to new information, demonstrating \nflexibility and prompt response to temperature changes [20]. \nProcess Monitoring and Control \nRecent research explores hybrid adaptive modeling approaches combining sequence encoding for online \nparameter identification with PINNs [22]. These models can be utilized for real-time applications with \nvariable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, enabling dynamic adaptation to \nchanging process scenarios [22]. \nApplications extend to process monitoring systems that integrate PINNs with autoencoders for quality \nassessment during LPBF processes [23]. These multimode AI systems predict temperature fields at \nsubsequent time steps based on current surface temperature distribution data, classifying process states \nas success, warning, or failure [23]. \nRecent Advances and Future Directions \nEnhanced PINN Architectures \nCurrent research focuses on optimizing neural network architectures for improved computational \nefficiency [1][2]. Developments include conservative PINNs (cPINN) using separate networks for sub-\ndomains and extended PINNs employing generalized decomposition methods [1]. Adaptive activation \nfunctions have shown promise in improving learning ability and convergence speed for both forward and \ninverse differential equations [1]. \nMulti-Physics Integration \nAdvanced PINN implementations are expanding to include more complex physics phenomena such as \nphase changes, temperature-dependent material properties, and plastic deformation [1]. Integration of \nmechanical property prediction and in situ process monitoring applications through incorporation of \nmechanical property equations represents a significant advancement [23]. \nComputational Efficiency and Scalability \nResearch continues to address computational challenges through improved collocation point selection \nstrategies, non-uniform distribution based on physics considerations, and parallel processing capabilities \n[1][16]. Sequential PINN approaches for multi-track scenarios demonstrate potential for handling increased \ncomplexity in industrial applications [16]. \nConclusion \nPhysics-informed neural networks represent a paradigm shift in metal additive manufacturing modeling, \noffering significant advantages over traditional purely physics-based or data-driven approaches [1][4][2]. \nThe integration of governing equations directly into the loss function enables accurate predictions with \nreduced data requirements while maintaining physical consistency [3][4]. Applications span both Direct \nEnergy Deposition and Powder Bed Fusion processes, with demonstrated success in thermal modeling, \nstress prediction, and real-time process control [1][20][10]. \nFuture research directions include enhanced multi-physics modeling, improved computational efficiency, \nand expanded applications to inverse problems for parameter identification and process optimization \n[1][2]. The continued development of physics-informed approaches promises to advance the adoption of \nmetal additive manufacturing in industrial applications through improved process understanding and \ncontrol [2][24]. \n⁂ \n \n1. \nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18786.pdf                   \n2. https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/publications/physics-informed-machine-learning-for-metal-additive-manufacturin      \n3. https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/heattransfer/article/143/6/060801/1104439/Physics-Informed-Neural-\nNetworks-for-Heat-Transfer        \n4. https://www.elspub.com/papers/j/1780789964309692416.html    \n5. https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/12/17/2819  \n6. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10856669/   \n7. https://summit.sfu.ca/item/39059    \n8. https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12304    \n9. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827124004864   \n10. https://www.engineering.com/neural-network-predicts-melt-pool-morphology-in-powder-bed-fusion/      \n11. https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1070063   \n12. https://bioengineer.org/revolutionizing-melt-pool-prediction-introducing-the-transfer-learning-enhanced-physics-\ninformed-neural-network-tle-pinn/  \n13. https://arxiv.org/html/2403.00669v2    \n14. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4189609   \n15. https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-epfl-2022/talks/physics-informed-neural-networks-for-thermal-analysis-\nof-lpbf-process  \n16. https://arxiv.org/html/2502.01820v1      \n17. https://arxiv.org/html/2412.13993v2    \n18. http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05624.pdf  \n19. https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02282   \n20. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11243035/       \n21. https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/13/3306   \n22. https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14252   \n23. http://e-jwj.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.5781%2FJWJ.2024.42.4.3    \n24. https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10761  \n",

Introduction \nAbstract \nPlease note, the abstract will be published in Aramis \n \nRegulatory changes mean that solutions to control sprouting in stored potatoes are evolving.  Vivent \nand its partners are developing a system to optimise novel anti-sprouting treatment applications and \nencourage the use of environmentally preferable agents. \nManagement Summary \nPlease note, the executive summary will not be published in Aramis \n \nPotatoes are the world’s fourth most important food crop, cultivated on 16.5 million hectares in 150 \ncountries for a total global output of 359 million tonnes in 2020.  Potatoes can be stored for up to 11 \nmonths before consumption. Sprouting during storage needs to be avoided as it leads to quality \nand weight losses. Sprouting accelerates weight loss leading to economic losses and it can also \ninduce sugar accumulation in the tuber reducing its quality. To delay and minimize sprouting, potatoes \nare kept in storage at low temperatures and anti-sprouting compounds (ASC) applied. Chlorpropham \n(CIPC) was used for decades for its efficiency and affordability to mitigate sprouting. However, due to \na risk for human health, CIPC was removed from the European and Swiss markets in \n2020. Alternatives such as “Dormir”, “Argos” (orange oil), mint oil, and ethylene have not been able to \nmatch the efficacy and low cost of CIPC. The impact being that storage costs have increased, passing \non costs to processors and the consumer.  \nVivent, the world leader in monitoring plant signals, have conducted  preliminary trials that show \nthat sprouting can be predicted up to 3 weeks prior to visual symptoms. To move towards a \ncommercial offering, Vivent requires data on a range of storage conditions and information on \nhow ASCs affect tuber electrophysiology responses. Vivent will provide alerts sent to farmers and \nstorage managers with advance notice of sprouting so that they can make timely choices for the \napplication of ASC. \nWith Agroscope, UPL, fenaco, and Zweifel, we will monitor for sprouting before visual signs appear \nand test ASC spray schedules guided by Vivent’s technology to find the most efficient and \nenvironmentally sound protocol. We will work with FFHS and SUPSI on the development of prediction \nalgorithms and on analysis of data linked to treatments. With PRONTO products and \nservices, Vivent expects additional revenues of CHF2.5M by 2027 and to employ an additional 5 \npeople.  \n \nContext \n \nThematic Area:  \nLife sciences \nCluster:  \n \n \nAgrotech \nSpecial Funding Measure:  \nNo special funding measure \n \nIs the application a follow-up of an idea financed in the frame of an Innosuisse Innovation \nBooster? \n \nSwiss Food Ecosystems \n \nHave any of the topics in this application been previously developed with Innosuisse or other \nfunding instruments? \n  \n  \nInnovation cheque:  NTN Innobooster “Patate – Smarter use of anti-sprouting treatments using plant \nsignaling” (28.12.21-8.) \n  \n  \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n4/49 \n \n  \n  \n  \nHas any member of the staff who will collaborate on the application been seriously sanctioned \nfor violations of scientific integrity in the last 3 years? No \n \n \nIntellectual Property Rights \n \nWas a patent search performed with or without IPI (Swiss Federal Institute for Intellectual \nProperty)? \n \nYes, with IPI (Swiss Federal Institute for Intellectual Property) \nA patent search was carried out using key words \"potato, sprout, detect, intercellular, and \nelectrophysiology\". Findings showed that there are no patents held worldwide that are in any way \nsimilar to Vivent's work using electrophysiology to detect sprouting. Any patents held that relate to the \ndetection of sprouting in potatoes use other technologies e.g. hyperspectral imaging or optical \nimaging. To our knowledge none of these patents have yet to be commercialised. \n \nHave the project partners concluded a prior written agreement regarding the assignement or \nexploitation of any research findings or patents? \n \nNo \n \nDoes the project require (patent-)licencense(s)? If yes, please explain which background IP is \nneeded for the project and the ownership of that background IP. \nYes \nBackground IP that is currently owned by Vivent for data acquisition and processing, and hardware \ninclude the following: \nPM338714US for electroceutical treatment granted in 2020 \nPM341595US for plant health monitor granted in 2020 \nPM348634GB for electrophysiological assessment of plant status using supervised machine learning \ngranted  in 2022 \nPM358580GB for activation reporting options for plant health monitoring granted 2022 \n \nThese will all be used in the project. Further patents are in preparation for prediction of plant health \nstatus and crop yield using grouped growth indices, assessment of crop treatment efficacy based on \nplant responses. We will also look to patent \"early prediction of sprouting in stored potatoes using \nelectrophysiology and supervised machine learning\". \n \n \n \nAttached IPR Documents:  \n• \nPatent Search.pdf \n \n \n2.

We \naim to apply our technology to make agriculture more sustainable. Vivent currently employs \n17 people based in Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, UK and Canada. In 2022, Vivent \ngenerated CHF800k revenue selling services to farmers working in controlled environment \nconditions and to agtech businesses. Vivent is funded by thefounders C. Plummer and N. \nWallbridge,Astanor Ventures, a leading food and agtech VC, Joseph Rizzi, a founder of Silicon \nValley VC Matrix Partners and through a FIT loan from the Canton Vaud. Vivent has a strong \ntrack record in successful completion of innovation projects and subsequent commercialisation \nof results. \n  \nProblem definition \nAfter harvest, the value chain requires long-term storage to supply high quality potatoes for \nyear-round processing to meet market demand (fig.1). Over 90% of potatoes are stored or \nprocessed before consumption.  \n \n  \n \nFigure 1: Simplified Value Chain for Processed Potato Products  \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n8/49 \n \n As potatoes age they sprout, water content drops,  and  sugar content increases causing \nunwanted browning when cooking. These factors mean a reduction in the weight and quality \nof the tuber, reducing its value. Typically there will be a weight loss of 4-7% over 6 months \nstorage. Managers have sought solutions to slow the aging process and avoid \nsprouting. Historically, stored potatoes have been treated with anti-sprouting compounds \n(ASCs) such as CIPC (Chloropham). The use of ASCs prolongs the dormancy period of \npotatoes (postponing sprouting) or burns the sprouts. CIPC an effective, inexpensive \ntreatment was used globally. However, it was withdrawn from the European market in 2020 \n[1] due to concerns about toxicity.  CIPC alternatives are more expensive and less effective. \nThe application of ASCs, is most effective when applied before sprouting causes weight loss. \nThere is currently no reliable method to predict sprouting.This constrains storage \nmanagers to follow a risk-free strategy and apply ASCs regularly, e.g. every 2-3 weeks.   \nASCs incur costs e.g. for a storage chamber of 1000 tonnes, the cost of treatment on a \nregular basis can cost 2000 to 4,500 CHF/application.   There is an inherent environmental \nfootprint in the application andproduction of ASCs.   \n  \n  \nNovel solution \nThe project collaborators have extensive knowledge in optimising potato storage and are \nexcited to develop a new approach, that will provide advance notifications of sprouting to \nstorage managers.  Plants, including tubers, constantly react to changes in the environment \nby emitting signals that coordinate growth and defence. Vivent records these signals which are \ninterpreted using machine learning (ML), enabling the detection of a wide range of \nphysiological changes, including ageing and sprouting.  Until ML was available it was \nimpossible to interpret the signals. This field of research is currently delivering important \nscientific breakthroughs with Vivent and Agroscope recognized as leaders. The application of \nelectrophysiology to predict sprouting is novel and this technology will make big contributions \nacross the potato value chain and could potentially be extended to other stored vegetables, \nfruits and ornamental plants.  \n  \nVivent will develop a service of alerts and dashboard (fig. 2a, 2b) that potatoes will sprout \nwithin a specific window, and with enough early warning. These will enable storage conditions \nto be optimised and ASC applications to be scheduled. This will ensure continued supply of \nhigh quality, low cost processed potato products, and increase profitability in the supply chain. \n \n \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n9/49 \n \n \n \nFigure 2a: Vivent alerts service for potato storage managers  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2b: PRONTO dashboard and alerts service \n \nEconomics of the solution for a typical client  \nAs an example of the economics of the product Vivent aims to deliver via PRONTO, two \nscenarios are presented for a storage facility holding 1000t of potatoes (fig. 3). We expect to \nextend the period between treatments (thereby reducing the number of treatments) over the \nstorage cycle and in addition reduce weight losses by managing aging better. \n \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n10/49 \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Optimisation of ASC applications with PRONTO \n \n \nCompetitive situation \nCurrently there are no sensors that provide early warning of potato sprouting on the market. \nStorage managers rely on observing signs of sprouting and using the ASC manufacturer’s \ntreatment guidelines to plan spraying. Several optical techniques have been researched, but \nnone commercialized, they rely on visible changes [2-3]. In storage chambers a person \nregularly scouts for visible signs of sprouting. In addition, sugar analyses can be performed on \nstored tubers to give an indication of their ageing. The application of electrophysiology in this \ndomain is highly innovative.  \nThere are only two companies offering plant electrophysiology products and/or services, but \nnot entering the potato sprouting market. Vegetal Signals (France) offers irrigation \nmanagement services for vineyards. Lehner Systems (Germany) has developed a tool that \nfocuses on drought stress prediction but they have not yet begun commercialization.  \n  \nOpportunity  \nThe potential market is large and valuable (fig. 4). Potatoes have a growing season of 3 to 4 \nmonths, in Europe most potatoes are harvested August/September. For potatoes to be \navailable to consumers or processors throughout the year, they must be stored for up to 11 \nmonths, depending on the variety.  \n \n \n  \n \nFigure 4: Key Facts - Potato Production and Storage \n  \nGlobal potato production in 2020 was 359M tonnes, and the value of the global potato \nprocessing market in 2020 was $27 billion. In Europe, production is highly concentrated, with \n73% of EU potato production in 2020 coming from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium \nand Poland. These countries produced 40M tonnes of potatoes in 2020. The total value of \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n11/49 \n \nEuropean potato production was estimated at €12.3 billion in 2020 (Eurostat July 2021). In \nSwitzerland, annual production is around half a million tonnes, and the Swiss consume 45 kg \nof potatoes per person per year, making them the most important source of energy in the Swiss \ndiet.  On average in Europe, 25% of potatoes are stored and a typical cost of storage excluding \nsuppressants is €50/tonne. Approximately 90% of stored potatoes are treated with ASC. This \nenables the calculation of market sizes (fig. 5).  \n \n  \n \nFigure 5: Market Sizes: Optimised Potato Storage \n  \n  \n  \nThe Product \nVivent will provide B2B services to large scale commercial suppliers and potato processors. A \nsubscription-based model will be offered covering several storage cycles. The primary \ncustomers are large-scale commercial potato suppliers and processors. The key benefits for \nusers are cost savings from reduced spoilage/water loss, fewer applications of ASC and \nimproved quality of stored potatoes. We forecast that users will reduce ASC treatment costs \nby about 30 - 40% per year and will reduce storage losses by 3%.  In addition, there are \nenvironmental benefits from reduced energy use for spraying and lower environmental impact \nfrom ASC applications.  \n  \nTarget Value Chain Position  \nA detailed value chain is shown in fig. 6. In Switzerland, fenaco is a leading supplier, and \nAgroscope provides advice on a range of issues across the value chain. Vivent’s potential \nclients are shown and will include fenaco, UPL and Zweifel. Vivent will service the market \nthrough distributors that provide crop treatments and equipment to potato farmers and \nprocessors (ie UPL or fenaco) and directly to the largest potato processors (ie Zweifel).   \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n12/49 \n \n \n \nFigure 6: Detailed Processed Potato Value Chain  \n \nPlanned revenues  \n  \nVivent’s business model will focus on penetrating the European market. With 55M tonnes of \npotatoes produced in Europe annually, and over 14M tonnes of stored potatoes there are about \n12,000 potential clients storing on average more than1’000 tonnes. We will sell to these \nstorage facilities via distributors. Installation will be done by storage managers themselves. \nVivent’s business model is based on a growing sales by about 100% each year for the first 4 \nfull years achieving sales of over CHF10M after 5 years. At this time Vivent will achieve about \n30% market share in the main potato storage countries in Europe. After that, Vivent will target \nmarkets outside of Europe, starting with North America. Vivent will explore North Africa and \nthe Middle East producing 28M tonnes of potatoes annually. \n  \nVivent’s planned revenues from the project are shown in (fig.7) with initial sales in 2025 and \nstrong market penetration in the following years. At end of 2029 Vivent projects a market \nshare of approx. 30% in Europe and 5% in North America.We will continue to scale sales \nbeyond the 5 year planning horizon if the current regulatory environment remains stable.  \n \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n13/49 \n \n \n \nFigure 7: Vivent Sales Projections \n \nVivent’s business model is based on rental of devices by contracting large scales growers and \nor potato storage companies for a period of 3 storage seasons. Preliminary market research \nshows that pricing Vivent’s services based on a proportion of cost savings is of interest to key \nclients. Our current estimate is that we can charge approximately 10% of the expected cost \nsavings from reduced treatments and weight losses.  \nAs shown in fig.3 Vivent’s decision support system will generate savings of CHF43k for a 6 \nmonth storage season and we modelled forecast revenue based on a charge of CHF3k/season \nplus a fee for distributors of CHF1k per season leading to a compelling ROI for clients of over \n10X.  \n  \nThis project will create 3 direct and 9 indirect jobs during the project growing to more than 8 \nFTEs direct and 30 indirect jobs as the business scales.  The ROI on the project is good with \nthe investment of slightly more than CHF1M yielding a positive return in the 12 months \nfollowing the end of the project.  \n  \n  \nKey Clients  \nVivent will market products and services primarily to potato storage and processing \nbusinesses however it will also sell services to a range of people with interest in the quality of \nstored potatoes such as the agro-chemical sector (fig. 8).    \n \n \nFigure 8: Key Clients and Client Benefits \n  \nProduct Delivery  \nPotato storage sector: the delivered product is a regular report on the likelihood of sprouting \nin the next 7 – 21 days plus a real-time alert when the prediction that sprouting will occur within \na chosen period exceeds a threshold. The alert will be based on the algorithms developed \nduring the project plus thresholds that Vivent and the partners will validate during the second \nseason. The report and alert will be delivered automatically via email/SMS. Vivent will deliver \nautomated reporting using an existing data pipeline that will be modified for this application.  \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n14/49 \n \n  \nLarge scale potato processors:Vivent will develop consolidated reports as decision support \ntools covering several storage facilities that will enable processors to optimise stock \nmanagement and processing schedules. We also expect to provide valuable information on \nthe state of potatoes during reconditioning (a first stage in many processing operations). This \nwill be a new product for Vivent and will be created as part of WP7.  \n  \nAgro-chemical industry Vivent will work with clients to provide insights on product efficacy \nand electrochemical responses to active ingredients. Note that Vivent already sells services \nto the agrochemindustry so will be adding a new product to an existing market segment.  \n \n  \n3.2 Describe potential customers and how they are to be reached \nMarket Access and Marketing Approach  \nVivent expects that users of early sprouting detection and crop health monitoring services will \npay a nominal amount for hardware and then a subscription for on-going services. \n  \nThey expect to conclude agreements with distributors who already provide and service large \npotato storage facilities. Being able to work directly with Fenaco and UPL as part of this project \nwill enable Vivent to test and refine distribution and / or licensing agreements. Vivent will focus \non Europe, specifically the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany and Poland to start \ncommercialization and then move to Canada and the USA. \n  \nVivent will develop a market launch plan including securing several pre-sales agreements with \nleading potato processors and service providers. We will also build on a client database that \nis used to generate demand for distribution partners.  Vivent will create evidence-based claims \non user benefits such as reduced weight loss and application costs to support product pricing. \nQuantified environmental benefits will be a cornerstone of marketing efforts.  \n  \nProduct efficacy claims for the UPL treatments are likely to be produced and will increase sales \nof these environmentally preferable products.  \n  \nImplementation Plan  \n \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n15/49 \n \n \n \nFigure 9: Commercial Implementation Plan  \n  \nThe process leading to product launch is shown in fig. 9 and is divided between marketing \nand product activities.  Partner discussions will include all aspects of the plan and product \nfeature design and feedback. Vivent will develop prototypes to gather feedback on features \nfrom partners, potential clients and distributors. They are aiming to create an intuitive, easy-\nto-use, reliable product.  \nVivent’s assumptions on geographic focus will be refined as will pricing and distribution \nmodels. A large database of potential users will be compiled throughout the project in \nadvance of the launch to support pre-sales activities. These will include beta trials with early \nusers who will receive sprouting prediction alerts via a mobile app which will be developed \nand trialed in market testing in 2025. Early users and research partners will also validate \nproduct efficacy including threshold levels in Season 2 trials. In late 2024 a go-to-market plan \nincluding product branding, a press kit and media campaign will be developed in advance of \na soft launch in September 2025 that will enable Vivent to scale sales in the 2025/26 storage \nseason. After the soft launch additional user feedback will be used to refine the product and \nservice offer for future seasons.  \n \n \n3.3 Does the planned project have a particular relevance to energy or ecological or \nsocial impacts that are noteworthy? \n  \n  \nPrediction of sprouting allows for more responsible processing of potatoes. The proposed \nsolution allows for better timing of sprouting suppression treatments, reducing the number of \nproduct applications for the same efficacy. Fewer treatments reduces the likelihood of \nresidues in the final product, benefiting the environment and human health.  In addition, \nbetter timing of applications makes the products more effective, and possible to store \npotatoes longer.  Moreover, if fewer potatoes sprout thanks to these targeted applications, \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n16/49 \n \nthere will also be less post-harvest waste.  By avoiding waste, local resources can be \nmaximized allowing for a more responsible consumption of potato products.  \n \n \n \nAttached Business Plan  \n• \nBusiness Plan deck_PRONTO.pdf  \n \n \n4. Solution \n \n  \n4.1 Describe the state of the art that you intend to advance.   \n \nThe quality of potato tubers is dependent on several attributes being maintained at appropriate levels \nduring storage [4]. Potato sprouting represents a major concern for potato growers and storage \nmanagers as it causes a negative impact on the marketability of tubers and therefore on revenue.  \n  \nCurrent approaches that exist to avoid sprouting are: decreasing storage temperature [5-7] or spraying \nanti-sprouting compounds (ASC) [8-10]. The application of ASC is most effective when applied early \n(before causing weight loss to potatoes). This constrains storage managers to follow a risk-free strategy \nand hence apply ASC on a regular basis. \n  \nThe ASC CIPC was associated with a risk of toxicity for the consumer and has been banned by the \nEuropean Union [1], which led to the development of less toxic but more expensive ASC. To mitigate \nthe cost, the application of these new ASC needs to be reduced. However, simply prolonging the time \ninterval in which the ASC are applied can lead to loss. To reduce the treatment of potatoes with ASC \nwhile not taking any risks, storage managers need to be able to detect early signs of potato sprouting.  \n  \nThese are the approaches currently considered to detect potato sprouting. Yu et al. [11] proposed a \nmethod to identify sprouting using imaging, achieving an identification rate of 94%. Jin et al. [12] \ncollected the hyperspectral imaging data of sprouted and normal potatoes and proposed a \nclassification model achieving an accuracy of 97.3%. Qiao et al. [13] used hyperspectral imaging to \nestimate water content and weight, and introduced an artificial neural network-based approach to \nidentify sprouting, achieving an accuracy of 97%.  \nWhile these approaches can identify sprouting with high accuracy, they rely on visual signs, and fail to \npredict the occurrence of sprouting ahead of time, which renders the potatoes not suitable for \nmarketing purposes. \nThere has been no prior research or industrial efforts focused on the use of electrophysiological signals \nto detect or identify potato sprouting. Likewise, no previous efforts focused on the detection of potato \nsprouting prior to any visual signs. There is no technology in use in storage chambers to detect \nsprouting before visible signs. As mentioned in the \"Competitive Situation\" section (3.1), there are two \ncompanies that are developing crop electrophysiology monitoring in Europe. Neither of them try to \nassess sprouting in storage, or combining electrophysiology measurements with ML techniques. \n \nVivent’s proposed solution aims to exploit the electrophysiological signals of potatoes  to predict, prior \nto visible signs, sprouting activity. Signals associated with sprouting can be observed in the tuber 3 \nweeks prior to the appearance of visible signs. \n  \nAgroscope developed a model relying on a weather database of 3’379 records from multi-year and \nmulti-environment trials performed with more than 500 potato varieties, to predict the end of \ndormancy period for potatoes stored at  8°C [14] with a precision of 15 days. While a 15-day precision \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n17/49 \n \nis acceptable considering the duration of an entire potato storage season (up to 11 months), a solution \nthat shrinks this time frame to a couple of days, and extends to potatoes stored at different \ntemperatures (4°C), promises significant advantages in terms of cost, revenue, and quality of potatoes.  \n  \nIn PRONTO, the aim is to predict sprouting of potato tubers weeks prior to its occurrence, using \nelectrophysiology. This has the advantage of providing a direct measure of physiological changes in \npotatoes, which can be exploited by state-of-the-art AI techniques to detect early signs of sprouting. \nThis solution will further drive the application of the ASC, suggesting treating potatoes only when \nnecessary, reducing the rate and cost of treatments,  improving potato quality and increasing revenue.  \n  \nFrom a ML point of view, the problem of early detection of potato sprouting can be modeled as a time-\nto-event problem [15]. Similar problems are studied in the literature [16-25] and used in the following \nuse-cases: \n• \nprediction of the remaining useful lifetime of an item in predictive maintenance  \n• \nin medical applications to predict the time to an event of interest (death, recurrence of a \ntumor, conception, discharge from hospital, etc.) \n• \ncustomer churn prediction \nThe methods used span from ML to statistical methods such as survival analysis or a combination of \nthe two. The methods differ if they use a continuous-time or a discrete-time modeling.  \n  \n  \n \n \n \nFigure 1: State of the art for potato sprouting management \n \n4.2 Describe the novelty of your solution (technology, product, business model or \nprocess, service).  \n \nUniqueness created: product / process / services \nThe uniqueness of the proposed solution lies in the cross-field combination of cutting-edge ML \ntechnologies and sensor monitoring of the electrical signals of potatoes with the aim of predicting the \noccurrence of sprouting weeks in advance. The solution gives an edge with respect to existing methods \nthat cannot detect sprouting before the appearance of visible signs. Additionally, the methodology can \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n18/49 \n \nbe employed to detect early sprouting events in potatoes under different conditions (e.g., storage \ntemperature), which further generalizes the proposed solution and adds to its novelty.  \n  \nThe solution will also leverage on techniques of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) which, by \nexplaining the reasoning of the ML algorithms to reach certain decisions, extracts insights about the \nproblem at hand and enhances the trust towards the solution. The early detection of sprouting enables  \nimprovements in other agriculture processes, such as the optimization of potato storage management. \nThe novelties brought by the proposed solution are:  \n  \n• \nCombination of Plant Electrophysiological Signals and ML technologies: our solution is the \nfirst of its kind to exploit electrophysiological signals and ML technologies to predict the \noccurrence of potato sprouting.  These signals are measured by Vivent’s state-of-the-art \nsensors that are physically connected to potato tubers and use ML techniques to predict \noccurrence of sprouting. \n• \nGeneralization of sprouting detection under different conditions: our solution meets the \nquantifiable goals on all varieties of potatoes and different storage conditions. Achieving these \ngoals is a challenge that requires that the collected data is reliable and representative of all \nsprouting activity of the different varieties of potatoes.    \n• \nExplainability: our solution will be designed to be explainable. The application of XAI \ntechniques aims at enhancing the understanding of the developed models, extract insights, \nincrease trust and decrease potential costs caused by model errors. \n• \nOptimization of potatoes storage: one of the benefits of early sprouting detection is the \npossibility to optimize the storage of potatoes. The accurate prediction of sprouting \noccurrence enables storage chamber managers to define priority batches of early-sprouting \npotato varieties, reducing or avoiding the use of ASCs and optimizing storage management to \nminimize the costs and environmental impact of ASCs. \n  \n  \n \n \nFigure 2: Uniqueness and novelty \n \n \nScientific/technological/societal ambition and risk, e.g., technology readiness level (TRL)  \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n19/49 \n \nSoftware: Besides continuing the development of stressor specific algorithms (e.g., thrips, aphids, \nstinkbugs and fungal diseases), Vivent is working on a set of additional automated tools for growers \nand food processors. This includes the Potato Sprouting Detector, which is currently at TRL3. \nHardware: The PhytlSigns Researcher (TRL 9) commercially available for greenhouse and outdoor \ngrowers. For potato sprouting,  changes will be needed to the device and electrodes (TRL5). \n  \n Primary applicability of research results  \nThe primary applicability of the research results of this project is the detection of potato sprouting in \nstorage facilities and the optimized application of ASC. \n Wider interest in applicability of research results  \nThe results will be beneficial for monitoring sprouting in other crops that are kept in storage, e.g.  \nedible food crops  (carrots, sweet potato, and cassava). The production of sweet potatoes (105M \ntonnes  produced globally every year) requires proper storage management, if not, sprouting and \nrotting can lead to an increase in waste and weight loss.  This project's findings will be valid for crops \nsuch as onions, garlic, and leeks. Another sector that will benefit from this project is the ornamental \nflower market. The Netherlands exports 3 billion tulip bulbs per year, which also require proper storage \nand monitoring systems to postpone sprouting until the right time for the customer. \n \n4.3 Describe the quantifiable goals to reach.  \n \nTechnological and scientific goals \n \nChallenge 1: Signal Processing and Feature Extraction to Assess Potato Sprouting \nDescription \n \nThe quality of potatoes depends on several attributes being maintained at the right levels during \nstorage. One of these is sprouting which affects the marketability of tubers and their processed \nproducts. The challenge consists in assessing these signs from electrophysiology measurements by \ndeveloping a proper signal processing and feature selection strategy able to capture the attributes \nrelevant to sprouting while discarding unnecessary information. \n  \nGoals:  \n• \nEnhance the signal to noise ratio (i.e., to remove from the signal irrelevant information) \n• \nEnhance the representation of the signal by removing components of the signal that are \nirrelevant to sprouting \n• \nPerform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to obtain relevant insights on the data \n• \nDefine and extract features from electrophysiological signals that are specific to potato \nsprouting \n• \nExtract and identify interpretable features   \n  \nSolution: \nTo achieve these goals, project partners will develop a signal processing and features selection pipeline \nusing a combination of  strategies such as spectrum analysis, signal decomposition, feature extraction \nand selection, data visualization, and dimensionality reduction. Note that several of these strategies \nheavily benefit from the use of a ML approach. As an example, denoising autoencoders outperform \nhandcrafted filters designed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce data dimensionality. \nHence, ML strategies are required to properly address this challenge.  \n  \nBenchmark: \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n20/49 \n \nDifferent signal processing and EDA techniques for feature extraction for potato sprouting are \ncompared and documented.  \n  \nChallenge 2: Development of a Machine Learning-based early warning system for potato sprouting \n  \n \n \nFigure 3: Development of a Machine Learning-based early warning system for potato sprouting \n \n \nDescription: \nASCs can extend the shelf life of potatoes; however, their regular and continuous application are \nexpensive. An early and highly accurate detection system  would be more cost-effective and \nsustainable. This could be achieved by leveraging electrophysiological measurements  from potatoes \nand ML techniques to predict the occurrence of potato sprouting weeks prior to occurrence.  \n  \nThe proposed system considers two  interconnected factors to decide whether to raise a warning or \nnot (see Fig.3): \n• \nWarning time: prediction time from the current moment to the sprouting event within a \ncertain warning confidence (i.e., sprouting will occur in 2 weeks).  \n• \nWarning confidence: time interval in which the model is confident that sprouting will occur at \nthe warning time. To allow chemicals to be sprayed in a more targeted manner, this interval \nshould be as short as possible.  \n  \nThe challenge consists in developing a model able to predict the likelihood of a sprouting event within \na short period of time, as early as possible. The model should  also be applicable to different sorts of \npotatoes (see WP2 and WP3). A broader generalization to include storing conditions, seasonality, and \nspraying status will be attempted. \n  \nGoals: \n• \nDevelop (a) ML model(s) for early detection of potato sprouting for different storage \nconditions and for potatoes that have, and haven’t yet undergone treatment. \n• \nDevelop an early warning system for potato sprouting based on the electrophysiological \nsignals of potato tubers. \n  \nSolution: \nThe early warning system for potato sprouting will be based on ML methodologies that predict the \ntime-to-event of sprouting based on an electrical signal from potatoes. Note that an ML-based system \nis required to build an effective system for early detection of potato sprouting. The task at hand is \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n21/49 \n \ncomplex, no theory exists that can support the design of proper hand-crafted inference algorithms. It \nis still unknown how to identify early signals of sprouting from electrophysiological signals. Therefore, \na strategy that learns how to identify such signals in a data-driven fashion needs to be followed. \nAccording to the representation of the output, different ML techniques will be considered: \n• \nAs a regression ML problem, where the output variable is the expected time sprouting will \noccur, with an associated confidence interval. \n• \nAs a binary or multi-class ML classification problem, the output variable is the probability that \nthe sprouting occurs in corresponding discrete time windows. \n• \nSurvival analysis, where we model probability that the sprouting will (not) occur by time t.  \n  \nUsing the findings of exploratory data analysis (challenge 1), different input representations will be \nconsidered. The complexity of the mapping from input to output will be tuned from simple benchmarks \n(e.g., linear models, tree-based models) to more complex deep learning models (e.g., artificial neural \nnetworks and transformers).  \nThe model with the most desirable interplay between the warning time and the warning confidence \nfor the required accuracy will be chosen. Besides the model performance, model explainability (see \nchallenge 3 and WP6 for a detailed description) will play a significant role for choosing the optimal \nmodel. \n  \nBenchmark: \n• \nA model able to predict the day when a potato tuber sprouts with a root-mean square error \nless than 3 days (warning confidence) and at least 2 weeks (warning time) before the true \nsprouting time. \n• \nA model able to pinpoint a time window of one week (warning confidence) when a potato \ntuber sprouts with an accuracy of at least 75% at least 2 weeks (warning time) before the true \nsprouting time. \n  \n  \n \nChallenge 3: Development of an explainable Artificial Intelligence Framework for early detection of \npotato sprouting \n \nDescription: \nThe application of ML models in academic research and industrial applications is commonly centered \non ML models’ predictive capabilities, neglecting aspects related to model’s interpretation and \nunderstanding. This lack of transparency prevents practitioners from trusting the model’s decisions. \nTo mitigate this issue and enhance the trust in ML models, XAI frameworks can be leveraged. Their use \nallows them to identify how the model correlates inputs to outputs, thus shedding light on which (and \nhow) features influence the model’s decisions. \n  \nFor the problem at hand, the application of XAI frameworks is important. As the early detection of \npotato sprouting is not yet investigated this increases the necessity of understanding ML models \ndesigned to solve it. In this context, XAI frameworks can provide insights into the factors triggering \npotato sprouting and on how the model's outcomes are correlated with the physical nature of potato \nsprouting. XAI can be used to debug the model's reasoning, thus increasing the trust in the model. \nMoreover, the conjunction of XAI with uncertainty quantification (i.e., how much the model is \nconfident about its decisions) can be used by domain experts to double-check the model’s decision \nbefore spraying, avoiding in this way unnecessary costs. This challenge consists of developing an XAI \nframework for detecting potato sprouting and analyzing model’s outcomes and reasoning.  \n  \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n22/49 \n \n \n  \nFigure 4: Development and Deployment of ML models \n \nGoals: \n• \nDevelop an XAI framework for explaining and interpreting decisions of developed ML models. \n• \nDevelop a framework that leverages model uncertainty and the explanations that describe its \nresults to reduce potential costs caused by ML model errors. \nSolution: \n• \nDevelop feature-attribution-based XAI frameworks such as Shapley Additive Explanations \n(SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) with features extracted \nin challenge 1.  \n• \nDevelop XAI frameworks that build on back-propagation based methods such as class \nactivation mapping and perturbation-based methods such as temporal attention layers, and \nante-hoc explanation methods such as attention mechanisms. \nBenchmark: \n• \nIdentify the underlying factors for early detection of potato sprouting as learned by the ML \nmodel are identified and explained. \n  \nEconomic and societal goals \n  \nAffordable alternative to CIPC: The ASCs currently available are expensive and several treatments are \nneeded to ensure optimal sprouting control. The storage management tools developed in this project \nwill delay the first treatment of potatoes and reduce the total number of treatments. \n  \nReduction in use of phytosanitary products. By performing the anti-sprouting treatments only when \nthey are really required, and not on a regular basis, a significant reduction of the number of treatments \nis achieved. For a storage chamber of 300 tonnes, savings are expected to be 9,000 CHF per treatment \n(calculation for a treatment with Dormir® product). \n  \nLimit chemical residues on tubers.The ASCs are applied directly on the tubers during storage, implying \nthat residues may be present on the surface when the potatoes are sold or transformed. By limiting \nthe number of treatments, we reduce the accumulation of residues at the surface of the tubers. \n \n \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n23/49 \n \n4.4 Describe the preliminary work already performed.  \n \nVivent has successfully worked with Agroscope on the  Innosuisse funded projects PISA (27661.1 \nPFLS-LS and  SIENA (42751.1 IP EE) to develop the hardware and ML technology on which Vivent’s \nbusiness is based for crops grown in greenhouses and outdoors. Vivent obtained the  NTN \nInnobooster “Patate – Smarter use of anti-sprouting treatments using plant signaling” (28.12.21-8.) \nin 2021 in order to carry out trials on potatoes in storage following preliminary work funded by \nVivent. In 2022, Vivent obtained a Databooster to carry out a Deep Dive on  “Classification of mild \ndrought stress in irrigated crops” with two new data science teams FFHS and SUPSI. It was decided to \nwork with these teams on the present proposal. \n  \nVivent’s preliminary work on potato sprouting consisted of 2 trials: \n1.Monitoring potato sprouting in Vivent’s labs (spring/summer 2021) The experiment was performed \non dormant tubers and revealed signal features related to sprouting, as evidenced by photographing \nthe potatoes in the dark with an infrared time lapse camera. Preliminary analyses on these trials \nindicated promising differences in the spectral composition of the acquired signals, where a specific \nfrequency band (1-48 hours) peaked 1 week before visual signs of sprouting. \n  \n2.Monitoring potato sprouting at Agroscope (Nov. 2021). The trials were conducted with potato \ntubers stored at 8°C and 4°C. The aim of this experiment was to improve the accuracy and \ngeneralizability of sprouting predictions and included trials on a broader range of varieties and storage \nconditions.

We refer to this task as ‘early warning’. At each instant of time, using electrophysiology \nmeasurements as input, the model should provide as output the probability of potato sprouting occurrence in a predefined number of days. \nSince factors triggering sprouting may change under different conditions, several ML models with different complexities and capacities will be \ntrained, tested, and compared. These models are distinguished based on potato variety, storage temperature, season, and spraying (not sprayed vs. \nsprayed). As stated in Challenge 2, given these variables, a broad generalization might not be possible. Attempts to generalize at least to potato \nvariety will be made. \nAll models will be trained, tested, and compared in a time-to-event-problem fashion whose output can be represented in different ways: \n• continuous-time (regression, output variable - real number, the time of sprouting with a confidence) \n• discrete-time (classification, output variable - discrete probability distribution, a probability for each time frame) \n• survival analysis (modeling probability that the sprouting will not occur by time t) \nFor each output representation, the performance of the models will be compared considering the following factors:  \n• Warning time: amount of time until the sprouting of potatoes occurs. The model should be able to raise a warning as early as possible.  \n• Warning confidence: time span in which the model is confident of potato sprouting.  When raising a warning, this interval should be \nsmall to provide actionable information. \nMetrics will be developed accordingly to measure accuracy in sprouting detection. Also, the complexity (e.g., amount of memory required, \nnumber of features in input, inference time) of the ML models will also be considered and evaluated. \n \n \nActivities \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n37/49 \n \n• WP5.1. Machine Learning Models Development: development, training and validation of several ML models with different input data \nrepresentations (see WP description). The complexity of the mapping from input to output will be tuned from simple benchmarks (e.g., \nlinear models and decision trees) to more complex models (ensemble models such as e.g., extreme gradient boosting models, and deep \nlearning models such as, e.g., CNNs, RNNs and transformer architectures. The outcomes of the training and validation will continuously \nfeed WP2 and WP3 to provide indications on data collection. \n• WP5.2. Testing and Comparing Developed ML models: The models developed in A4.1 are tested, and their performances are \ncompared in terms of the metrics discussed above in WP description. The outcome of WP5.2 will feed WP2 and WP3 with indications for \na further collection of data to improve model performance.  \n• WP5.3. Identifying the most suitable ML model: Selection of the best model or the best combination of models according to metrics \ntuned for the early warning task, optimizing the trade-offs between warning time, warning confidence, interpretability, and complexity. \nOutcomes of WP5.3 will feed and receive feedback from WP6. Additionally, the identification of the most suitable ML model will be \nevaluated considering the monetary impact of the use of anti-sprouting products. \n \n \nDeliverables \n• D5.1: A model or models that can perform early prediction of potato sprouting for potatoes that have not been treated with anti-sprouting \nproducts, considering both storage temperatures, different seasons and different varieties of potatoes.

We would be open to signing an agreement to pay CHF40k cash at the end of the project if, as expected, we are cash flow \npositive at that time. \n \nExplanations regarding the contributions of the implementation partner(s):  \n \nSalary Costs \n \nResearch Partners \n \nSUPSI - Scuola universitaria professionale della Svizzera italiana \n \n \nHourly rate (CHF)  \nTime on project (h)  \nAmount (CHF) \nHead of Institute/Department  \n79.00 \n40 h  \n3,160.00 \nExperienced scientists/Head \nof Team \n70.00 \n3436 h  \n240,520.00 \nScientific assistants  \n62.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nSpecialist \n53.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nDoctoral students and \nauxiliary staff  \n34.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nSalary costs  \n \n \n243,680.00 \nEmployer's contributions  \n20% \n \n48,736.00 \nTotal salary costs  \n292,416.00 \n \n \nFFHS - Fernfachhochschule Schweiz \n \n \nHourly rate (CHF)  \nTime on project (h)  \nAmount (CHF) \nHead of Institute/Department  \n79.00 \n40 h  \n3,160.00 \nExperienced scientists/Head \nof Team \n70.00 \n3096 h  \n216,720.00 \nScientific assistants  \n62.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nSpecialist \n53.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n45/49 \n \nDoctoral students and \nauxiliary staff  \n34.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nSalary costs  \n \n \n219,880.00 \nEmployer's contributions  \n20% \n \n43,976.00 \nTotal salary costs  \n263,856.00 \n \n \nAgroscope \n \n \nHourly rate (CHF)  \nTime on project (h)  \nAmount (CHF) \nHead of Institute/Department  \n92.00 \n180 h  \n16,560.00 \nExperienced scientists/Head \nof Team \n77.00 \n2300 h  \n177,100.00 \nScientific assistants  \n56.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nSpecialist \n55.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nDoctoral students and \nauxiliary staff  \n46.00 \n600 h  \n27,600.00 \nSalary costs  \n \n \n221,260.00 \nEmployer's contributions  \n20% \n \n44,252.00 \nTotal salary costs  \n265,512.00 \n \n \nImplementation Partners \n \nVivent SA \n \n \nHourly rate (CHF)  \nTime on project (h)  \nAmount (CHF) \nCTO, Head of R&D, Head of \nDepartment \n119.00 \n208 h  \n24,752.00 \nSenior Engineer / Senior \nSpecialist  \n95.00 \n3616 h  \n343,520.00 \nEngineer / Specialist  \n68.00 \n720 h  \n48,960.00 \nProfessional Staff \n61.00 \n240 h  \n14,640.00 \nAuxiliary Staff  \n46.00 \n320 h  \n14,720.00 \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n46/49 \n \nSalary costs  \n \n \n446,592.00 \nEmployer's contributions \n 20% \n \n89,318.40 \nTotal salary costs  \n \n \n535,910.40 \n \n \nfenaco Genossenschaft \n \n \nHourly rate (CHF)  \nTime on project (h)  \nAmount (CHF) \nCTO, Head of R&D, Head of \nDepartment \n119.00 \n252 h  \n29,988.00 \nSenior Engineer / Senior \nSpecialist  \n95.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nEngineer / Specialist  \n68.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nProfessional Staff \n61.00 \n200 h  \n12,200.00 \nAuxiliary Staff  \n46.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nSalary costs  \n \n \n42,188.00 \nEmployer's contributions \n 20% \n \n8,437.60 \nTotal salary costs  \n \n \n50,625.60 \n \n \nZweifel Pomy-Chips AG \n \n \nHourly rate (CHF)  \nTime on project (h)  \nAmount (CHF) \nCTO, Head of R&D, Head of \nDepartment \n119.00 \n242 h  \n28,798.00 \nSenior Engineer / Senior \nSpecialist  \n95.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nEngineer / Specialist  \n68.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nProfessional Staff \n61.00 \n500 h  \n30,500.00 \nAuxiliary Staff  \n46.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nSalary costs  \n \n \n59,298.00 \nEmployer's contributions \n 20% \n \n11,859.60 \nTotal salary costs  \n \n \n71,157.60 \n \n100.494 IP-LS -  PRONTO - Predicting Potato Sprouting to Optimise Tuber Storage \n \n47/49 \n \n \nUPL Europe Supply Chain GmbH \n \n \nHourly rate (CHF)  \nTime on project (h)  \nAmount (CHF) \nCTO, Head of R&D, Head of \nDepartment \n119.00 \n252 h  \n29,988.00 \nSenior Engineer / Senior \nSpecialist  \n95.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nEngineer / Specialist  \n68.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nProfessional Staff \n61.00 \n200 h  \n12,200.00 \nAuxiliary Staff  \n46.00 \n0 h  \n   0.00 \nSalary costs  \n \n \n42,188.00 \nEmployer's contributions \n 20% \n \n8,437.60 \nTotal salary costs  \n \n \n50,625.60 \n \n \nMaterial Costs \nMaterial costs that are necessary for the proper execution of the innovation project can be added below.

We used 3379 records from multi-year and multi-environment trials of 537 potato \nvarieties to identify the main factors driving potato dormancy and to develop predictive models for an efficient \nsprouting forecast. The variety explained the majority of the dormancy variability (60.3%), followed by the year \n(13.9%) and the location (5.4%). About 250 predictors were considered to develop a predictive model of potato \ndormancy. The selected model had a validation precision of 14.59 days; it used the variety class and the sum of \nthe daily maximum temperatures in the air during the period from planting to harvest as predictors. The pre­\ndictions of the selected model were supported by results of the in vivo trial using dormancy measurements from \npotato varieties grown under different temperature regimes in greenhouse conditions. With the growing impact \nof climate change on crop production, predictive models as developed here can provide an efficient and cost- \neffective tool to optimize the control of potato sprouting during storage.   \n1. Introduction \nAfter harvest, the potato value chain requires long-term storage to \nsupply high-quality potatoes for year-long processing to satisfy market \nrequirements. The evolution of physiological age leads to the breaking of \ndormancy and thus to the sprouting of potatoes during storage (Dela­\nplace et al., 2008). Sprouting alters potato quality by causing shrinkage, \nweight loss, and a decrease in turgidity (Alexandre et al., 2015; Son­\nnewald and Sonnewald, 2014; Teper-Bamnolker et al., 2010) and \ntherefore must be controlled. \nVarious approaches are used to control potato sprouting, such as \ndecreasing storage temperature (Blauer et al., 2013; Magdalena and \nDariusz, 2018; Muthoni et al., 2014), using chemicals to delay sprouting \n(Corsini et al., 1979; Mahajan et al., 2008; Paul et al., 2016b), or using \nthe dormancy length of potato varieties to manage storage (Magdalena \nand Dariusz, 2018). The first approach may not be adequate for the \nstorage of potatoes dedicated to processing, as most varieties are \nsusceptible to sweetening when stored at low temperatures. This phe­\nnomenon of sweetening due to the accumulation of reducing sugars is \nalso called “cold-induced sweetening” (CIS) (Hou et al., 2017; Sowoki­\nnos, 2001). High sugar levels induce browning of the potato after frying \nand produce toxic compounds such as acrylamide that may raise con­\ncerns for human health (Paul et al., 2016a; Wiberley-Bradford and \nBethke, 2017). The advantage of using anti-sprouting products is their \nbroad effectiveness for any variety at any temperature. However, some \nproducts are associated with a risk of toxicity for the consumer, and \nthere is an increasing demand from consumers and national agencies for \nfood free of chemical products. Indeed, chlorpropham (CIPC) has been \nused for decades to control sprouting in potatoes, but the European \nUnion recently decided to not renew the approval of this molecule due to \nconcerns raised for consumers regarding this active substance and its \nmetabolite 3-chloroaniline, and due to the identification of data gaps \npreventing to perform a final consumer risk assessment (European \nCommission, 2019; European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) et al., \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail addresses: m.visse@doct.uliege.be, margot.visse@agroscope.admin.ch (M.

The metabolites of CIPC, such as aniline, have further increased \nconcerns for consumers since those molecules have been detected in the \npotato’s skin (Orejuela and Silva Poma, 2005; Paul et al., 2014; Smith \nand Bucher, 2012). Molecules that pose fewer health risks have been \nrecently commercialized, and they seem promising as replacements for \nCIPC, but their costs remain high; some require several applications to \nbe effective during the entire storage season, which is time-consuming \n(Curty, Personal communication), and it is unclear whether consumers \nand authorities will accept them in the future. Therefore, using potato \nvarieties with a long dormancy period could be a sustainable solution to \navoid or delay the sprouting of potatoes, thus avoiding or eliminating \nthe use of anti-sprouting products and consequently increasing the \nbenefits for human health and the environment. However, the dormancy \nof potato varieties is not known for all varieties, or information found \nabout dormancy is sparse and conflicting (Agriculture and Horticulture \nDevelopment Board (AHDB), 2019). Therefore, in this context, pre­\ndicting potato dormancy is of great interest for the management of \nstorage. For instance, the capacity to predict potato dormancy may \nallow the processing of priority batches of short-dormancy varieties, \nthus minimizing or avoiding the use of chemicals and optimizing the \nmanagement of stocks. \nPotato sprouting appears during storage after a break in the \ndormancy period (Coleman, 1987; Daniels-Lake and Prange, 2007), but \nthe definition of dormancy is subject to discussion. Reust (1982) \ndescribed dormancy as the “period between tuber initiation and the \ndevelopment of the first sprouts”. Emilsson (1949) mentioned a \"rest \nperiod\" where the potatoes are unable to sprout and a \"dormancy period\" \nwhere the tuber is maintained without sprouting under optimal condi­\ntions. Three periods were also defined: endodormancy regulated by \nphysiological factors internal to the meristem, paradormancy regulated \nby external physiological factors, and ecodormancy. During this last \nperiod, dormancy can be maintained under specific environmental \nconditions (Delaplace, 2007; Lang et al., 1987). It is necessary to take \ninto consideration that the length of this period depends on complex \nmechanisms to predict potato dormancy. In the literature, authors have \nreported that varieties display differential responses in dormancy length \n(Aksenova et al., 2013; Burton, 1978; Danieli et al., 2018; Daniels-Lake \nand Prange, 2007; Magdalena and Dariusz, 2018; Muthoni et al., 2014; \nSuffle et al., 2016). However, dormancy is also influenced by phyto­\nhormones, metabolites, and environmental conditions during both the \ngrowing season and storage (Aksenova et al., 2013; Delaplace, 2007; \nDelaplace et al., 2009; Muthoni et al., 2014; Reust, 1982; Sonnewald and \nSonnewald, 2014). Factors related to the growing season that influence \ndormancy include the temperature (Levy and Veilleux, 2007; Magdalena \nand Dariusz, 2018; Muthoni et al., 2014; Reust, 1982; Zommick et al., \n2014), the water supply (Czerko and Grudzi´nska, 2014; Muthoni et al., \n2014), the soil humidity (Firman et al., 1992), the soil fertility (Muthoni \net al., 2014), and the photoperiod (Fernie and Willmitzer, 2001; \nMuthoni et al., 2014). Firman et al. (1992) studied the importance of soil \nmoisture and physiological age on the emergence of seed tuber sprouts \nin the field. They showed that temperature influenced the growth rate of \nsprouts and demonstrated that the growth rate is different in dry soil \ncompared to wet soil. After harvest, the temperature and the atmosphere \ncomposition during storage also play important roles in dormancy \nduration (Aksenova et al., 2013; Burton, 1958; Caldiz, 2009; \nCelis-Gamboa et al., 2003; Czerko and Grudzi´nska, 2014; Daniels-Lake \nand Prange, 2007; Magdalena and Dariusz, 2018; Muthoni et al., \n2014; Reust, 1982; Reust et al., 2001; Struik, 2007a, 2007b; Struik et al., \n2006; Suttle, 2007). \nThe dormancy of the different potato varieties is subject to change \ndepending on the above-mentioned factors. Most of these environmental \nparameters will be affected in the future by climate change; therefore, it \nis of interest to identify and quantify the main variables influencing \ndormancy duration. This would allow the building of a robust predictive \nmodel of dormancy parameterized with predictors that are easy to re­\ncord in the field. The limitations of previous studies conducted on the \nsame topic include the small sizes of the datasets used and the use of only \na few varieties, or only a few years of trials. In the present study, we took \nadvantage of an unprecedented large dataset containing dormancy ob­\nservations obtained from field trials managed under contrasted envi­\nronmental conditions by Agroscope (Nyon, Switzerland) over a period of \n25 years. \nGiven the increasing climate variability, dormancy models can \nenable the improvement of potato storage management and reduce \nlosses caused by sprouting. \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Data collection and preparation \n2.1.1. Field trials \nField trials have been conducted during 25 growing seasons (from \n1990 to 2014) by Agroscope, the Swiss agricultural research center, in \nfive experimental sites located at different altitudes in Switzerland, \nnamely “La Frˆetaz” (elevation of 1200 m asl), “Les Mottes” (elevation of \n455 m asl), “Grangeneuve” (elevation of 680 m asl), “Goumo¨ens” \n(elevation of 609 m asl), and “Changins” (elevation of 420 m asl). A total \nof 537 varieties were tested, and each was included in at least three \ndifferent experiments, allowing the acquisition of 3379 records. All \nvarieties tested were varieties registered in the official European variety \ncatalog. They are listed in the Supplementary Material 1. Potatoes were \nplanted from March to June and harvested from August to September, \ndepending on the year and location. The soils were fertilized when \nnecessary following the usual agricultural practices. Before potato \nemergence, a herbicide was applied according to the best management \nrecommendations each year. Haulm destruction was implemented with \na combination of chemicals (various products) and mechanical treat­\nments (the EnviMaxX machine from Rema environmental machinery B. \nV., the Netherlands). Potatoes were treated to prevent late blight (Phy­\ntophtora infestans) approximately once a week from emergence to haulm \nkilling, using various fungicides. After harvest, potatoes were stored at \nroom temperature (around 15 ◦C) for two weeks in the dark to promote \nhealing. Then, the potato tubers were calibrated, weighed, and stored in \nwooden crates (0.6 ×0.4 ×0.18 m) at a rate of 10 kg per crate for each \nvariety, trial, and location. The tuber diameter used for the post-harvest \ntrials ranged from 42.5 mm to 70 mm. The temperature was gently \ndecreased from 15 ◦C to 8 ◦C at a rate of 3 ◦C every 48 h, and potatoes \nwere kept at 8 ◦C and 85% relative humidity (RH). \nDuring the 25 studied growing seasons, the following weather data \nwere collected from Agrometeo (https://www.agrometeo.ch/, accessed \n2017) and from MeteoSwiss (Federal Office of Meteorology and \nClimatology MeteoSwiss, Switzerland): the daily average temperature \n(◦C) in the air at two meters above the soil; the daily minimum tem­\nperature (◦C) in the air at two meters above the soil; the daily maximum \ntemperature (◦C) in the air at two meters above the soil; the daily \naverage temperature (◦C) at the level of the soil (i.e., at five cm above the \nsoil); the daily average soil temperature (◦C) at a depth of 10 cm; the \ndaily average relative humidity (%); the daily precipitation (mm); the \ndaily maximum precipitation intensity (= maximum precipitation per \nhour registered in the day) (mm/h); and the daily average insolation (=\nsolar irradiance) (MJ m-2). Plots were only irrigated for a few growing \nseasons and only at the “Changins” location. Irrigation data were \nhandled by adding the water amounts per day to the daily precipitation \ndata. The tuber initiation date was recorded for one location \n(Goumo¨ens), eight years and 67 varieties, which allowed the acquisition \nof 126 records. To fill this data gap, we set 16 days after the emergence \nas the date of theoretical tuber initiation for all locations in the dataset \nwhere this information was missing. This value was obtained by aver­\naging the period from emergence to tuber initiation date from the tuber \ninitiation recorded for the 67 tested varieties (average = 16.37 days). \nThe standard deviation of tuber initiation was 4.05 days, representing \nless than 5% (3.04%) of the entire growing period (from planting to \nM. Visse-Mansiaux et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nField Crops Research 278 (2022) 108396\n3\nharvest), which was on average equal to 132.94 days in the dataset. The \ndate of the main physiological stages of the crop (i.e., planting, emer­\ngence, tuber initiation, and maturity) and the dates of crop management \noperations (e.g. haulm killing and harvest) were also recorded and used \nto define the following periods: from planting to emergence, from \nplanting to tuber initiation, from planting to haulm killing, from \nplanting to harvest, from emergence to haulm killing, from emergence to \nharvest, from tuber initiation to haulm killing, from tuber initiation to \nharvest, and from haulm killing to harvest. For all these periods, the \nabove-mentioned weather data (e.g., temperature, precipitation, or \nrelative humidity) were summed and/or averaged for each period and \nrecorded in the database (list in the Supplementary Material 2). During \nstorage, potatoes were considered sprouted when 80% of tubers in the \ncrate had visible sprouts of a minimum length of three mm, according to \nthe definition of the end of dormancy established by Reust (1982, 1986). \nThe sprouting date was recorded at the time that the tubers first dis­\nplayed the characteristics described the abovementioned definition. In \nthis study, we will consider the dormancy period as follows: the period \nbetween the harvest and the sprouting date during storage. \n2.1.2. Greenhouse trial \nA greenhouse trial was conducted in which seed tubers of the Bintje \nvariety were placed at 18 ◦C and under light for 18 days to stimulate \ngermination before planting. A total of 42 tubers were planted in square \npots of 10 liters following good practices for greenhouse trial manage­\nment. A standard soil was used (Swiss mixture from the company RIC­\nOTER Erdaufbereitung AG, mixture for organic gardening, Switzerland; \ncomposition: 30% white peat 0–30 mm; 30% country soil sterile and \n40% Coco-Peat) and mixed with substrate for plant cultivation (Gerbr. \nBrill Substrate GmbH & Co. KG, Typ 4, Germany) (ratio 2:1). Ammo­\nnium nitrate fertilizer was added and mixed into the soil mixture; about \n30 g of fertilizer were mixed with 100 liters of soil mixture (ammonium \nnitrate fertilizer composition: total N = 27% + total Mg = 2.5% and Ca \n= 9%, LANDOR fenaco Genossenschaft, Switzerland). Plants were kept \nin the same room at ambient temperature for 10 days, corresponding to \n99% emergence (average temperature of 17 ◦C). The 42 plants were \ndivided into seven greenhouse chambers and grown at two different \ntemperatures (15 or 20 ◦C), with four chambers at 15 ◦C (four replicates) \nand three chambers at 20 ◦C (three replicates). Data loggers (LogTag® \ntemperature \nrecorder, \nmodel: \nTRIX-8, \nAmatemp´erature \nS`arl, \nSwitzerland) were placed close to the plants from planting to harvest to \nmeasure the air temperature for each replicate (one record per hour). \nPlants were irrigated manually two or three times a week, and a \nphotoperiod of 12 h of light and 12 h of dark was applied. To prevent \ninfestation by thrips (Thrips tabaci, Frankliniella occidentalis), we placed \nAmblyseius cucumeris auxiliaries in each plant (Andermatt Biocontrol \nSuisse AG). Potatoes were haulm killed 67 days after emergence and \nharvested 34 days after haulm killing to allow proper skin set. The \nharvested tubers were calibrated for each plant to identify the propor­\ntion of tubers (number and weight) smaller and larger than 32 mm. The \naverage weight per tuber of each caliber and from each plant was \ncalculated by dividing the total weight of tubers per plant by the number \nof tubers per plant. The tubers were then stored in a storage chamber at \n12 ◦C and 85% RH for one week to stimulate healing, and then the \ntemperature was lowered to 8 ◦C at a rate of 2 ◦C every four days. \nSprouting assessment was performed every two weeks. The length of the \nbiggest sprout of each tuber and from each plant was measured. \n2.2. Data analysis \nThe R software version 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2019) was used for data \npreparation and statistical analysis. \n2.2.1. Field trails \nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to confirm the ef­\nfect of the factors variety, location, and year on the potato dormancy \nduration. In this analysis, the 25 years of trials were considered, as well \nas the five locations and the 537 tested varieties. A given variety for a \ngiven year was considered as the experimental unit, and the dormancy \nduration from harvest until sprouting date was accessed for each \nexperimental unit. This allowed the acquisition of 3379 records (see \nSection 2.1.1.). The percentage of the variability explained by each \nfactor was calculated by the ratio of the sum of squares for the consid­\nered effect to the total sum of squares. \nAs some varieties were only tested three times during the 25 years of \ntesting, the prediction of the dormancy for those varieties could be less \nreliable due to a lack of sufficient reference dormancy values. Therefore, \nthe regression coefficients estimated by the ANOVA model for each \nvariety as a dummy variable were used to define an additional explan­\natory variable called “variety class”. Based on these estimates, varieties \ntested fewer than ten times during the 25 years of testing were placed in \nthe same variety class as the varieties closest in dormancy that were \ntested more frequently. However, all varieties that were tested at least \n10 times were kept to limit the bias that could come from the effect of \ncombination with other varieties less tested. Finally, 143 different va­\nriety classes were identified: 85 classes containing grouped varieties and \n58 classes containing individual varieties (i.e., tested at least 10 times). \nA validation was performed using one third of the records (randomly \nselected) for each variety class (N = 1102) to assess the accuracy of the \ndeveloped prediction model. The remaining samples were used to cali­\nbrate the model (N = 2277). Validation and calibration sets were inde­\npendent. This splitting was done using the CARET package version \n6.0–86 in R (Kuhn, 2020) that ensures the presence of all varieties in \nboth the validation and calibration sets. The predictors used in the \nregression were previously mentioned in the data section; however, \nvariety class was used instead of variety. Moreover, the location and the \nyear of testing were not retained in the prediction model because they \nwere characterized by the weather predictors. Consequently, 247 pre­\ndictors were considered to develop the model predicting potato \ndormancy. All predictors were not available for all records. The \ncompleteness of the calibration set varied from 44.1% (N = 1005) to \n100% (N = 2277) as follows: 94 predictors had a completeness of at least \n75%, 131 predictors had a completeness ranging from 50% to less than \n75%, and 22 predictors had a completeness of less than 50% (Supple­\nmentary Material 2). \nThe predictive model was built using a forward selection approach \nfor the predictors. So, the predictors were added to a linear model one by \none. First, 247 univariate regressions were performed. For each model, \nthe following statistical parameters were calculated: the coefficient of \ndetermination (R2c), the root mean square error (RMSEc) of the cali­\nbration, the RMSE (RMSEv), and the R2 of the validation (R2v). The \npredictor included in the univariate model with the highest R2v was \nkept. Then, bivariate regressions were developed by fixing the first \nretained predictor and testing the remaining 246 variables as the second \npredictor. Again, the second predictor was selected based on the model \nthat gave the highest R2v. This procedure was repeated until the inclu­\nsion of an additional predictor in the model explained less than 1% of the \nadditional variability in dormancy. This allowed us to avoid the po­\ntential problem of overfitting. Finally, all regression coefficients of the \nprediction model were studied to determine whether the model gener­\nated an expected weight for all selected predictors. \nThe qualitative effect of variety was studied using the regression \ncoefficients estimated by the selected model for each variety class \ndummy variable. Therefore, in our model, the effect of variety is rep­\nresented by 142 regression coefficients. By default, R software fixed the \nregression coefficient for the first variety class dummy variable to zero. \nThe result is that the coefficient of regression represents the averaged \ndormancy between the considered variety class and the one taken as \nreference. To better understand these data, the regression coefficients \nwere re-scaled after calculation using the Bintje variety as reference \nsince it was the most widely tested variety in our dataset. To re-scale the \ndata, the regression coefficient estimated for each variety class dummy \nM.

Greenhouse trial \nThe sum of daily maximum temperatures in the air from planting to \nharvest for each replicate (3 replicates for plants grown at 20 ◦C and 4 \nreplicates for plants grown at 15 ◦C from emergence to harvest) was \ncalculated using the maximum temperature recorded per day (one re­\ncord per hour). \nData for all measured variables of the six plants per greenhouse \nchamber were averaged before the analysis. Our experiment was con­\nducted using a nested design. We used a one-way linear mixed model \nwith the temperature of growth as a fixed effect (15 and 20 ◦C) to \nevaluate the number of small and large tubers and the average weight of \nsmall or large tubers after harvesting. The length of sprouts was fitted to \na two-way linear mixed model that included temperature (two levels: 15 \nand 20 ◦C) and the period of observation (days after harvest = DAH, four \nlevels) as fixed effects. Models were adjusted using the lme4 R package \nversion 1.1–23 (Bates et al., 2015). The data for the length of the sprouts \nwere transformed using “loge (x + 1)” to ensure the homogeneity of the \nvariance and normality. The greenhouse chambers were considered a \nrandom factor for all the models. The effect of the greenhouse chambers \nwas removed to improve the model when this effect was not significant. \nWe performed significance tests for the fixed effects for the measured \nvariables (with a confidence interval of 95%) using a Chi-square test or \nan F-test in cases where the effect of the random factor was not signif­\nicant. Calculations were performed using the “car” R package (Fox and \nWeisberg, 2019). The marginal post hoc Tukey test (emmeans method) \nusing the “emmeans” R package (Lenth, 2020) was used to compute the \nmultiple comparison post hoc tests to identify mean differences within \nfactors and interactions. For data summary and graphics, we used \nvarious R packages (\"ggplot2\", \"plyr\", \"Rmisc\", “lattice”, and \"cowplot\" \npackages) (Hope, 2013; Sarkar, 2008; Wickham, 2011, 2016; Wilke, \n2019). \n3. Results \n3.1. Main factors influencing potato dormancy \nIn this study, we considered dormancy as the period between the \nharvest and the sprouting date during storage. This definition is gener­\nally used in practice by the potato sector. The dormancy period varied \nfrom 27 days to 179 days, with an average of 96.29 days in the dataset \n(all varieties, years, and locations taken together). The variety effect \nexplained 60.3% of the dormancy variability (p < 0.001). Among the \n537 studied varieties, the dormancy period of the varieties varied on \naverage from 50 (Lucera [N = 3]) to 158 days (Taurus [N = 3]). Several \npopular varieties had short dormancies (e.g. Agata, Annabelle, Nicola, \nor Amandine, which displayed an average dormancy of 57 days \n[N = 22], 57 days [N = 16], 72 days [N = 25], and 75 days [N = 20], \nrespectively), while other popular varieties had long dormancies (e.g. \nAgria, Panda, Lady Claire, or Verdi, which displayed an average \ndormancy of 131 days [N = 96], 130 days [N = 24], 120 days [N = 68], \nand 120 days [N = 10], respectively) (Fig. 1). \nThe year effect explained 13.9% of the dormancy variability \n(p < 0.001). For instance, during the 25 years of testing for the Bintje \nvariety, the observed dormancy ranged from 67 days (N = 7) to 125 \ndays (N = 9) (Fig. 2). \nThe location effect was less important than the two above-mentioned \neffects and explained 5.4% of the dormancy variability (p < 0.001). The \naverage dormancy observed in the location “Changins” was 93 days \n(N = 2138), while in the “La Frˆetaz” (N = 576), “Goumo¨ens” (N = 219), \n“Grangeneuve” (N = 330), and “Les Mottes” (N = 116) locations, the \naverage dormancies were 110, 100, 92, and 88 days, respectively. \n3.2. Prediction model of potato dormancy \nA total of 247 univariate linear regressions were initially performed \nusing the calibration set and then applied to the validation set. R2v \nranged from 0.00 to 0.52, and RMSEv varied between 18.49 and 27.53 \ndays. For the sake of conciseness, all models are not shown; only the five \nmodels with the best values for goodness of fit are presented (Table 1). \nThe model explaining the majority of the dormancy variability included \nthe variety class as a fixed effect. The corresponding R2v was 0.52, \nwhich is well ahead of all other models (Table 1). The R2c was close to \nR2v (0.58 and 0.52), suggesting good model robustness. The RMSEv was \n18.49 days. The univariate model including the sum of the daily \nmaximum temperatures from tuber initiation to harvest had the highest \nR2v after the model that included the variety class (Table 1). The \ndifferent sample sizes used in the calibration and validation set between \nthe predictors are related to data availability, which may vary for the \npredictors used. The 247 predictors and the corresponding number of \nrecords for each predictor are listed in the Supplementary Material 2. \nFor the second step in the development of the predictive model, \nbivariate models that always included the variety class plus one of the \nFig. 1.

Visse-Mansiaux et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nField Crops Research 278 (2022) 108396\n5\n246 remaining explanatory predictors were evaluated. R2v ranged from \n0.41 to 0.70. RMSEv varied between 14.59 and 20.94 days. The five \nbivariate models with the best values for goodness of fit are presented in  \nTable 2. It is important to note that the five predictors represent tem­\nperature parameters. The differences in prediction performance be­\ntween models (Table 2) were less important than those observed \nbetween variety class and other tested predictors in the univariate \nmodels (Table 1). These low differences in prediction performance be­\ntween bivariate models might be due to collinearity between predictors. \nThe model with the highest goodness of fit for validation (R2v and \nRMSEv) relied on data with few missing records. This model included \nthe sum of the daily maximum temperatures in the air during the period \nfrom planting to harvest as a second predictor (Table 2) and explained \n70% of the variability in dormancy (R2v = 0.70). The RMSEv was 14.59 \ndays. By subtracting the part of the variability explained by the uni­\nvariate model including only the variety class, we can conclude that this \nsecond predictor explained an additional 18% of dormancy variability. \nBased on the regression coefficient (−0.02), the sum of the daily \nmaximum temperatures in the air during the period from planting to \nharvest had a negative influence on potato dormancy. \nA second validation analysis was performed to assess the robustness \nof the above-mentioned bivariate model. The bivariate models were run \nwith a smaller set of data used for the validation containing the same \namount of data for all the tested variables (N = 454 instead of \nN = 1048) (Supplementary Material 3). We observed that the bivariate \nmodel with the highest goodness of fit for validation is the same for both \ndataset (RMSEv = 14.92 and RMSEv = 14.59) (Table 2 and Supple­\nmentary Material 3). This validation analysis confirms the robustness of \nthe selected bivariate model with the sum of the daily maximum tem­\nperatures in the air during the period from planting to harvest as second \npredictor. \nThe third step in the development of the predictive model consisted \nof developing 245 models including three explanatory variables. The \nfirst and second predictors were the ones selected from the univariate \nand bivariate models, respectively. For the third step, the remaining \npredictors were evaluated. R2v and RMSEv for the 245 developed \nmodels ranged from 0.66 to 0.71 and between 14.33 and 15.83 days, \nrespectively. Table 3 summarizes the five three-trait models with best \nvalues for goodness of fit. \nAs already observed with the bivariate models, the differences in \ngoodness of fit between the best candidate models were small. The \nmodel showing the highest R2v included the average of the daily average \ninsolation data for the period from emergence to tuber initiation as the \nthird explanatory variable. This combination of variables explained 71% \nof the dormancy variability. \nThis corresponds to an increase of only 1.20% of R2v compared to the \nbivariate model (Table 4). Therefore, the prediction accuracy of a model \nincluding three predictors was not highly improved compared to the \nTable 1 \nCalibration and validation prediction performance of the five univariate models \npredicting potato dormancy with best values for goodness of fit.  \nDormancy ~ predictor \nCalibration \nValidation \nN \nR2 \nRMSE \n(days) \nN \nR2 \nRMSE \n(days) \nVariety class  \n2277  \n0.58  \n17.90  \n1102  \n0.52  \n18.49 \nSum of the daily \nmaximum temperatures \nin the air for the period \nfrom tuber initiation to \nharvest  \n1754  \n0.17  \n23.98  \n839  \n0.16  \n24.24 \nSum of the daily average \ntemperatures in the air \nfor the period from \ntuber initiation to \nharvest  \n1746  \n0.16  \n24.12  \n835  \n0.16  \n24.25 \nSum of the daily \nmaximum temperatures \nin the air for the period \nfrom emergence to \nharvest  \n1730  \n0.16  \n24.06  \n822  \n0.16  \n24.23 \nSum of the daily average \ntemperatures in the air \nfor the period from \nemergence to harvest  \n1722  \n0.15  \n24.23  \n818  \n0.15  \n24.27 \nN = number of samples, R2 = coefficient of determination, RMSE = Root mean \nsquared error. \nTable 2 \nCalibration and validation prediction performance of the five bivariate models \npredicting potato dormancy with best values for goodness of fit.  \nDormancy ~ variety class +\npredictor \nCalibration \nValidation \nN \nR2 \nRMSE \n(days) \nN \nR2 \nRMSE \n(days) \nSum of the daily \nmaximum temperatures \nin the air for the period \nfrom planting to harvest \n2175  \n0.72  \n14.32 \n1048  \n0.70  \n14.59 \nSum of the daily \nmaximum temperatures \nin the air for the period \nfrom tuber initiation to \nharvest \n1753  \n0.73  \n14.31 \n839  \n0.69  \n14.75 \nSum of the daily \nmaximum temperatures \nin the air for the period \nfrom emergence to \nharvest \n1729  \n0.73  \n14.25 \n822  \n0.69  \n14.70 \nSum of the daily average \ntemperatures in the air \nfor the period from \nplanting to harvest \n2167  \n0.72  \n14.50 \n1044  \n0.69  \n14.75 \nSum of the daily average \ntemperatures in the air \nfor the period from \ntuber initiation to \nharvest \n1745  \n0.72  \n14.42 \n835  \n0.69  \n14.83 \nN = number of samples, R2 = coefficient of determination, RMSE = Root mean \nsquared error. \nTable 3 \nCalibration and validation prediction performance of the five models predicting \npotato dormancy using three predictors with best values for goodness of fit.  \nDormancy ~ variety class \n+ sum of the daily \nmaximum temperatures in \nthe air for the period from \nplanting to harvest \n+ predictor \nCalibration \nValidation \nN \nR2 \nRMSE \n(days) \nN \nR2 \nRMSE \n(days) \nAverage of the daily \naverage insolation data \nfor the period from \nemergence to tuber \ninitiation \n1546  \n0.75  \n13.80 \n736  \n0.71  \n14.33 \nAverage of the daily \nmaximum temperatures \nin the air for the period \nfrom planting to harvest \n2175  \n0.73  \n14.09 \n1048  \n0.70  \n14.46 \nAverage of the daily \naverage insolation data \nfor the period from \nhaulm killing to harvest \n1901  \n0.74  \n14.17 \n919  \n0.70  \n14.60 \nPeriod from planting to \nharvest \n2175  \n0.73  \n14.18 \n1048  \n0.70  \n14.51 \nAverage of the daily \naverage temperatures in \nthe air for the period \nfrom planting to harvest \n2167  \n0.73  \n14.12 \n1044  \n0.70  \n14.50 \nN = number of samples, R2 = coefficient of determination RMSE = Root mean \nsquared error. \nM.

Moreover, the average of the daily average \ninsolation data for the period from emergence to tuber initiation that \nwas included as the third explanatory variable in the model is not easy to \ncollect in the field. \nModels with four, five, and six predictors were also tested, and we \nfound R2v values of 0.73, 0.74, and 0.75, respectively. Their respective \nRMSE values were 13.90 days, 14.01 days, and 13.82 days (Table 4). We \ndid not go further than six predictors because the additional predictor \nexplained less than 1% of the dormancy variability (Table 4). As \nobserved for the models including three predictors, the models with \nfour, five, and six predictors had only a marginal increase in R2v and \nimprovement of prediction accuracy compared to the selected bivariate \nmodel (Table 4). Thus, since the most robust model is always the most \nparsimonious, the model with best values for goodness of fit is the one \nincluding two explanatory variables (Table 2). Moreover, this model had \nthe advantage of including variables that are easy to record in the field. \n3.3. Varietal differences in dormancy \nThe effect of variety was modeled as a categorical variable, and it \nwas studied using the selected bivariate model. The regression co­\nefficients for the main 58 individual varieties tested in our dataset and \nrescaled based on the Bintje variety are presented in Fig. 3. Several \nvarieties had regression coefficients close to the one estimated for the \nBintje variety (i.e., fixed at zero), meaning that the dormancy of these \nvarieties is close to the dormancy of Bintje. For instance, the dormancy \nof the varieties “Charlotte” (regression coefficient = −2.26 days), \n“Gourmandine” (regression coefficient =\n0.64 days), “Granola” \n(regression coefficient = 4.25 days), “Challenger” (regression coefficient \n= - 2.87 days), “Erika” (regression coefficient = 2.50 days), or “Juliette” \n(regression coefficient = 3.47 days) were similar to the reference \ndormancy of the Bintje variety. In contrast, the variety “Agata” had a \nshorter dormancy of 42.57 fewer days compared to the Bintje variety. \nFor the variety “Agria”, dormancy was 30.09 days longer than the \ndormancy of the Bintje variety (Fig. 3). \n3.4. In vivo validation of the model \nBased on the composition of the bivariate model, after variety, the \nsum of the daily maximum temperatures in the air for the period from \nplanting to harvest is the environmental factor that most influences \ndormancy variability. To test the relevance of this effect, different \ntemperatures were applied under controlled conditions in the green­\nhouse trial from emergence to harvest. This resulted in obtaining two \ndistinct average sums of daily maximum temperatures in the air from \nplanting to harvest. The average sum of daily maximum temperatures in \nthe air from planting to harvest was 2706 ◦C ± 122 (mean ± standard \nerror, N = 4) for plants grown at 15 ◦C and 3223 ◦C ± 144 for plants \ngrown at 20 ◦C (mean ± standard error, N = 3). \nAfter harvest, the average number and weight of the large tubers \n(caliber > 32 mm) were not significantly different between the plants \ngrown at 15 ◦C (6.8 tubers/plant and 44.7 g) and 20 ◦C (7.1 tubers/ \nplant and 53.5 g) (P values = 0.75 and 0.16). The average number and \nweight of the small tubers (caliber < 32 mm) were also not significantly \nTable 4 \nPerformance of the models including one to five predictors within the forward \nselection.  \nNumber of \npredictors \nVariable added to the \nmodel \nValidation \nR2 \n% of variability \nexplained by \nthe added \npredictor \nRMSEv \n(days) \n1 \nVariety  \n0.52  \n51.82  \n18.49 \n2 \nSum of the daily \nmaximum \ntemperatures in the \nair for the period from \nplanting to harvest  \n0.70  \n17.82  \n14.59 \n3 \nAverage of the daily \naverage insolation \ndata for the period \nfrom emergence to \ntuber initiation  \n0.71  \n1.20  \n14.33 \n4 \nAverage of the daily \nmaximum \ntemperatures in the \nair for the period from \nemergence to tuber \ninitiation  \n0.73  \n1.75  \n13.90 \n5 \nSum of the daily \naverage soil \ntemperatures at a \ndepth of 10 cm for the \nperiod from maturity \nto harvest  \n0.74  \n1.30  \n14.01 \n6 \nAverage of the daily \nmaximum \ntemperatures in the \nair for the period from \nplanting to emergence  \n0.75  \n0.72  \n13.82 \nR2 = coefficient of determination, RMSEv = validation root mean squared error. \nFig. 3.

The \nlength of the sprouts during storage was significantly impacted by the \ntemperature during the growing period between emergence and harvest \n(P value = 0.02) and by the time of observation measured in days after \nharvest (P value < 0.001). We also observed an interaction between the \ntemperature during the growing season and the time of observation (P \nvalue = 0.02). At the beginning of the storage period (74 DAH), \nsprouting was absent or low, and the length of the sprouts from tubers \ngrown at 20 ◦C (average of 0.2 mm) was not significantly different from \nthe length of the sprouts of tubers grown at 15 ◦C (average of 0.0 mm) (P \nvalue = 0.52). At 103 days after the harvest, the length of the sprouts of \nthe large tubers was significantly higher for plants grown at 20 ◦C \n(average of 1.6 mm of sprouts) when compared to 15 ◦C (average of \n0.3 mm of sprouts) (P value = 0.01). The length of the sprouts of the \nlarge tubers at 88 and 119 days after harvest was also higher for plants \ngrown at 20 ◦C (average of 0.6 and 4.4 mm) compared to 15 ◦C (average \nof 0.0 and 2.4 mm). However, it should be noted that the differences for \nthese last two observation periods were not significant, even though the \nP values were low (0.08 and 0.07) (Fig. 4). \nWe also observed a faster increase in sprout length during storage for \nplants grown at 20 ◦C compared to plants grown at 15 ◦C. Sprouting \nfrom tubers grown at 20 ◦C started to significantly increase at 103 DAH. \nThe length of the sprouts at 103 DAH was significantly higher (average \nof 1.6 mm) compared to the length of the sprouts at 74 days and 88 days \nafter harvest (average of 0.2 and 0.6 mm) (P values < 0.001 and 0.01) \nand continued to significantly increase at 119 DAH (average of 4.4 mm) \ncompared to sprouting at 103 DAH (P value < 0.001). Sprout length at \n74 and 88 DAH was not significantly different (P value = 0.11). \nSprouting of potatoes grown at 15 ◦C started to increase later, at 119 \nDAH. The length of the sprouts was significantly higher at 119 DAH \n(average of 2.39 mm) compared to the length of the sprouts for the first \nthree observations at 74, 88, and 103 DAH (average of 0.0, 0.0, and \n0.3 mm) (P value < 0.001) for which sprouting was low and not \nsignificantly different (lowest P value = 0.13). \n4. Discussion \nWith the non-renewal of the most used anti-sprouting product CIPC \nin Europe (European Commission, 2019), a proper management of po­\ntato storage will be vital to avoid economic losses. Anti-sprouting \nproducts that are replacing CIPC on the market often require more \ntreatments during the storage season and thus are time-consuming and \nhave a higher cost compared to CIPC (Curty, Personal communication). \nTherefore, the use of dormancy should be considered to improve potato \nstorage management, and the model built in our study could be an \ninstrumental tool to help farmers in their decisions and to avoid losses \nduring potato storage. \nThe main factor determining the duration of potato dormancy \nhighlighted by this study was the variety. This explained 60.3% of the \nvariability and was the most critical variable used to predict the dura­\ntion of dormancy. We observed a range of 108 days between varieties. \nThe lowest dormancy was 50 days for the Lucerna variety; the longest \nwas more than three-fold higher: 158 days for the Taurus variety (see \nFig. 1). Our results are in line with Magdalena and Dariusz (2018); they \nobserved dormancy periods ranging from 78 to 155 days, depending on \nthe variety, among six potato varieties tested during three seasons of \nstorage at 8 ◦C. \nThe second important factor determining the duration of potato \ndormancy is related to environmental conditions. Indeed, the year and \nlocation together explained almost 20% of the variability in dormancy \nduration (19.3%), while 13.9% was explained by the year. Thus, year \nhad a higher impact on the duration of dormancy than location. In our \ntrials, the dormancy of the Bintje variety ranged from 67 to 125 days, \ndepending on the year. Magdalena and Dariusz (2018) also observed \nsignificant differences in sprouting date between different years of \ntesting and varieties, and underlined that these differences were due to \nthe effect of weather conditions during the growing period of the potato \nplants. It has been reported in the literature that the water supply \n(Czerko and Grudzi´nska, 2014; Muthoni et al., 2014), the temperature \n(Levy and Veilleux, 2007; Magdalena and Dariusz, 2018; Muthoni et al., \n2014; Reust, 1982; Zommick et al., 2014), the soil humidity (Firman \net al., 1992), the photoperiod (Fernie and Willmitzer, 2001; Muthoni \net al., 2014), or the soil fertility (Muthoni et al., 2014) during the \ngrowing season greatly influences the length of the potato dormancy \nperiod. These interactions between dormancy and weather conditions \nwere also present in our dataset. The response of the Bintje variety il­\nlustrates this; after a growing season with a heatwave (year 2003), the \ndormancy was only 67 days, while after a colder growing season (year \n2008), the dormancy was almost two-fold longer–125 days (Fig. 2). Our \nresults show that effect of both variety and environment drives the \nlength of potato dormancy and underline the effect of climate change on \npotato dormancy. The expected temperature increase over the next \n30–50 years is predicted to be in the range of 2–3 ◦C (Hatfield and \nPrueger, 2015; IPCC, 2007). With such an increase in average temper­\natures during the growing season of potatoes, we can expect a short­\nening of the dormancy of tubers during storage, with practical \nconsequences for storage management. Among those consequences, we \ncan mention the necessity of early anti sprouting treatments, or the \nnecessity to lower the average temperatures of storage, with conse­\nquences for tuber quality with enhanced CIS. \nThanks to our large dataset, we built models to predict the sprouting \ndate of a given potato variety considering its dormancy length and the \nenvironmental factors related to its growing season. Within our models, \nwe used weather variables of the different years and locations instead of \nyear and location as categorical factors, which have no predictive power \nthemselves. Of all the models for predicting potato dormancy length \ntested in our study, the bivariate model including the variety and the \nsum of daily maximum temperatures during the period from planting to \nharvest showed a good fit explaining 70% of the variability of the \nobserved dormancy, which is 18% better than the univariate model with \nonly variety as a predictor. This model predicted the dormancy period \nwith a precision of 14.59 days. This level of precision can be considered \nsufficient in comparison with the average duration of potato storage, \nwhich may extend up to eight months (Curty, Personal communication). \nThe robustness of the selected bivariate model was confirmed by a \nsecond analysis performed with a smaller set of data used for the vali­\ndation containing the same amount of records for all variables (N = 454 \nFig. 4. Average length of the sprouts for the large tubers (caliber > 32 mm) \nfrom plants grown at two average sums of daily maximum air temperature from \nplanting to harvest, i.e. 2706 ◦C ± 122 (plants grown at 15 ◦C, mean \n± standard error, N = 4) and 3223 ◦C ± 144 (plants grown at 20 ◦C, mean \n± standard error, N = 3) for each observation in days after harvest (= DAH). \nFor a given observation, groups sharing the same letter are not significantly \ndifferent (Tukey test, confidence level of 95%). \nM. Visse-Mansiaux et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nField Crops Research 278 (2022) 108396\n8\ninstead of N = 1048). Other bivariate models with different variables \nwere presenting similar performances in term of prediction (Table 2). \nThe added value of the selected model, in addition to its highest good­\nness of fit, is that it offers the advantage of using variables that are easy \nto collect in the field and therefore is easy to use in practice by the \ngrowers. \nThe study of the regression coefficient showed a negative impact of \nthe sum of the daily temperatures from planting to harvest (−0.02). This \nmeans that the dormancy length decreases when this temperature in­\ncreases. This temperature effect was confirmed by our in vivo experi­\nment. Indeed, we conducted a greenhouse trial to check the effect of the \nenvironmental variable that most influenced the dormancy duration \nafter the variety factor and selected through the models. The Bintje \nvariety was chosen because it was the most represented variety in our \ntrials. We found that at 103 DAH, the length of the sprouts of the large \ntubers from plants grown at 20 ◦C was significantly higher (average of \n1.6 mm of sprouts) than the ones grown at 15 ◦C (average sprout length \nof 0.3 mm). In this greenhouse experiment, we also observed an effect of \ntemperatures during the growing season on the speed of growth of the \nsprouts during storage. Faster sprouting was observed for tubers from \nplants grown at 20 ◦C for which the increase in sprouting significantly \nbegan at 103 DAH, compared to tubers harvested from plants grown at \n15 ◦C for which the increase in sprouting was only significant at 119 \nDAH. These results are consistent with our models as well as with the \nliterature since authors conducted studies on different varieties and \nshowed that high temperatures during the growing season lead to \nreduced dormancy (Levy and Veilleux, 2007; Magdalena and Dariusz, \n2018; Zommick et al., 2014). This impact of temperatures during the \ngrowing season on the dormancy length can be explained because high \ntemperatures during the growing season are known to accelerate the \nphysiological aging of the tubers (Caldiz et al., 2001) leading to several \nphysiological and biochemical modifications related to the end of \ndormancy (Delaplace et al., 2009; Fukuda et al., 2019). \nTo verify the relevance of the regression coefficient estimates, we \nmade a comparison of the dormancy information for a few varieties \nfound in the literature. To facilitate the interpretation of these estimates, \nwe have shown those results compared to the Bintje variety (Fig. 3). \nBintje is usually described as a variety with medium to long dormancy \naccording to the references (European Cultivated Potato Database, \n2020; Le plant de pomme de terre Français, 2020; NIVAP, 2011). Vari­\neties with an estimate in Fig. 3 close to zero also have a medium to long \ndormancy period (e.g. Gourmandine, Granola or Erika). We noticed that \nfor some varieties, such as Agria, Agata, or Erika, the dormancy length in \nour model and in the literature were comparable (Agrico, 2020; Euro­\npean Cultivated Potato Database, 2020; Le plant de pomme de terre \nFrançais, 2020; NIVAP, 2011), while for other varieties, the dormancy \nlength was slightly different. For instance, the dormancy of the Granola \nvariety is described in the literature as long to very long (European \nCultivated Potato Database, 2020; Solana GmbH & Co. KG, 2020), while \naccording to our bivariate model, this variety has a medium to long \ndormancy (4.25 days longer than Bintje, see Fig. 3). The small differ­\nences between the estimate of dormancy given by our model and the \ndormancy provided by the breeders can be explained by the fact that our \nestimates are based on a large dataset with multi-environmental trials, \nwhile the dormancy provided by the breeders is generally based on trials \nmanaged in less contrasted environmental conditions. This highlights \nthe need to collect information related to the weather conditions during \nthe growing season and to harmonize the dormancy characterization of \npotato varieties. \nIn addition to its sufficient accuracy, this model was chosen as the \nmost appropriate because it was robust (i.e., calibration and validation \nresults were close) and the predictors included in the model are easy to \ncollect in the field. Indeed, the planting and harvest dates are obviously \nknown, and the daily maximum temperature is readily available from \nweather stations located in the surrounding area of the field or through \nsimple temperature sensors that can be placed in the field during the \ngrowing season. Furthermore, in the context of pesticide reduction, \nusing the dormancy information provided by our model to avoid or \ndelay the use of chemicals to store potatoes is also of great interest. \nSeveral practical storage strategies should be undertaken according \nto the final use of the potato (processing or fresh market) and depending \non the dormancy duration of the varieties (short, medium, or long), as \nwell as the desired storage duration (short-term storage or long-term \nstorage). \nThe ideal scenario to prevent the use of anti-sprouting products \nwould be to use varieties with long dormancies that can be stored for a \nlong period at 8 ◦C and that do not require the application of anti- \nsprouting products for several months. Our model does not allow esti­\nmation of the dormancy of a variety for which the variety class of \ndormancy is unknown or not properly characterized. Therefore, it would \nbe necessary to define the average dormancy of such varieties by testing \nthem in the field and comparing their dormancy period with one of the \ncontrol varieties for which the variety class is well characterized (e.g. \nthe Bintje variety). This would enable us to integrate those varieties in \nour model to estimate the date of sprouting for a given storage season. \nHowever, using varieties with long dormancies cannot be the only \nsolution given that market requirements are driving the choice of vari­\neties to be produced (Curty, Personal communication); therefore, it is \nadvisable to also store varieties with medium and short dormancies. For \nshort- and medium-dormant varieties, storage must be carefully planned \nfor each season of storage to avoid food and thus economic losses. Based \non the weather during the growing season, our model could be used to \npredict the dormancy period of these varieties and provide advice on \nwhich of the varieties will sprout first and therefore should be sold first, \nand which varieties will sprout later and can be retained. Another \nchallenge for the adoption of this model by interested stakeholders is the \ncollection of representative data for validation. Indeed, to maximize the \naccuracy and applicability of a model, it is important to collect large \namounts of data using standardized protocols. \nDepending on the predicted sprouting date, cold storage could be \nused to extend the dormancy of potato varieties. However, this is usually \nnot possible for processing varieties because such storage induces \nsweetening at low temperatures, leading to a risk of production of toxic \ncompounds during potato frying that may raise concerns for human \nhealth (Paul et al., 2016a; Wiberley-Bradford and Bethke, 2017). \nNevertheless, some varieties that are not sensitive to sweetening can be \nstored at low temperatures without any problems (Visse-Mansiaux et al., \n2019). Since our model was developed based on potatoes stored at 8 ◦C, \nit is not appropriate to predict sprouting for potatoes stored at lower \ntemperatures (e.g. 4 ◦C). Such a prediction would require a revision of \nthe model with new data for dormancy from tubers stored at lower \ntemperatures. A correction coefficient or a new model could then be \ncalculated. Such a corrected model dedicated to cold storage may be \neffective for the management of the storage of varieties for fresh markets \nthat are usually stored at low temperatures. \nFinally, trials are being conducted worldwide in which the potato \ndormancy date is recorded, and for which weather information is often \nreadily available. This large amount of data from different countries \ncould be collected and would allow for a better characterization of the \ndormancy of many varieties and a better prediction of the dormancy for \na wider range of environmental conditions. This would facilitate the use \nof the dormancy information for storage management in the future. This \ntool will help anticipate the consequences of climate change on potato \nstorage losses caused by sprouting and thus improve long-term food \nsecurity. It could also effectively contribute to the development of a \nmore sustainable agriculture sector by decreasing the use of chemicals \nthrough better management of potato storage and consequently answer \nthe demands from consumers to avoid chemicals in food. \nIn conclusion, our study confirms the important impact of tempera­\ntures during the growing season on the dormancy period and shows that \na bivariate model can predict with an acceptable level of accuracy the \ndormancy period for a given variety according to specific weather \nM.

In this paper, we\npropose to test diﬀerent methods of automatic classiﬁcation in order to identify when diﬀerent environmental\ncues cause speciﬁc changes in the electrical signals of plants. In order to verify such hypothesis, we used machine\nlearning algorithms (Artiﬁcial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Network, Optimum-Path Forest, k-\nNearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine) together Interval Arithmetic. The results indicated that Interval\nArithmetic and supervised classiﬁers are more suitable than deep learning techniques, showing promising results\ntowards such research area.\n1. Introduction\nPlants as sessile and modular organisms face the challenge to keep\ntheir stability growing in environments under constant changing (Souza\net al., 2016). Since plants lack a central command to organize the en-\nvironmental information gathered in each module (e.g., a branch root\nor a leaf), an eﬃcient communication system has evolved in order to\nintegrate local information (cell-to-cell communication) and to signa-\nlize through the plant body (long-distance communication) (Trewavas,\n2003; Lüttge, 2012).\nLong-distance communication, also referred to as systemic com-\nmunication, can be triggered by diﬀerent stimuli, such as biotic ones\n(e.g., systemic acquired resistance as a response to pathogens) or by\nabiotic stimuli (e.g., water deﬁcit, heat, and salinity). Therefore, the\nultimate goal of these systemic signaling is to activate response me-\nchanisms in remote tissues, improving the ability of the whole plant to\nprepare its tissues to an upcoming challenge (Gilroy et al., 2014).\nAmong the signals involved in long-distance communication, ROS (re-\nactive oxygen species), calcium and electrical signals perform a central\nrole (Baluska, 2016).\nIn plants, there are diﬀerent types of electrical signals, which are\nelectrical activities involving changes in membrane potential, such as\naction potential (AP), variation potential (VP, or slow wave - SW), and\nsystem potential (Davies, 2006; Sukhova et al., 2017). APs are char-\nacterized by spike-like changes of the resting membrane potential and,\nindependent of the stimulus strength, start propagating through the\nplant with a deﬁned amplitude and velocity. Like in animals, APs seem\nto be all-or-nothing events (Fromm and Spanswick, 1993; Pyatygin\net al., 2008). VPs diﬀer from APs in various ways. VPs do not obey the\nall-or-nothing law, they are known as slow wave potentials (SWPs) with\nvariable shape, amplitude and time frame. Moreover, the signals are\nrelated with the stimulus strength, and last for periods of 10 s up to\n30 min (Zimmermann and Mithofer, 2013; Vodeneev et al., 2015).\nSystem potentials (SPs), in contrast to APs and VPs, reﬂect a systemic\nself-propagating hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane or depo-\nlarization of the apoplastic voltage. Like VPs, SPs have a magnitude and\nduration that are depended on the stimulus, but they are initiated via\nmembrane hyperpolarization through the sustained activation of the\nproton pump. SPs are dependent on experimental conditions, and then\nthey may occur under a very speciﬁc set of environmental conditions\n(Zimmermann and Mithofer, 2013; Choi et al., 2016). Furthermore,\nquite often all these signals are mixed altogether, which impairs a\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.12.024\nReceived 15 August 2017; Received in revised form 12 December 2017; Accepted 15 December 2017\n⁎ Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: danilopereira@unoeste.br (D.R.

Strong\nevidences have demonstrated that bioelectrical signals play a central\nrole in both cell-to-cell and long-distance communication in plants\n(Baluska et al., 2006; Zimmermann et al., 2009; van Bel et al., 2014),\nalso supporting the ability to adjust their phenotypes to diﬀerent en-\nvironmental conditions (Fromm and Lautner, 2007; Gallè et al., 2015;\nRìos-Rojas et al., 2014). For instance, Sukhov et al. (2014) and\nMagdalena et al. (2017) have demonstrated the role of electrical signals\nin the regulation of photosynthetic responses to diﬀerent stimuli.\nVery recently, Souza et al. (2017) proposed the concept of “plant\nelectrome” based on the general proposition of “electrome” by De Loof\n(De Loof, 2016), describing the totality of the ionic currents in diﬀerent\nscales of plant organization. By measuring low-voltage electrical signal\nusing eletrophytography (EPG) (Debono, 2013; Souza et al., 2017),\nSouza et al. (2017) showed that diﬀerent environmental stimuli could\nchange some characteristics of the temporal dynamic of the electrical\nsignaling, including the level of complexity. It was noticed that some\nspeciﬁc frequencies, which were observed in non-stimulated plants, have\ndisappeared after stimulation. Moreover, the environmental stimuli\nchanged the type of color noise of the electrical signals. However, it was\nnot clear if the diﬀerent environmental cues (cold, low light, and osmotic\nstress) caused distinct eﬀects on the plant signals (Souza et al., 2017).\nTherefore, measuring the level of stress in plants is of crucial im-\nportance to a better understanding of their working mechanism.\nHowever, automatic plant stress identiﬁcation by means of machine\nlearning techniques has been considered recently only. Singh et al.\n(2016) presented an overview about machine learning tools and their\napplications in the context of biotic and abiotic stress traits classiﬁca-\ntion. The main goal of such work is to guide the plant community when\nusing machine learning techniques in the aforementioned situation.\nTwo years earlier, Ma et al. (2014b) also considered a similar study, but\nin a more general way, and Ma et al. (2014a) employed machine\nlearning\nto\nstudy\nstress-responsive\ntranscriptomes\nin\nArabidopsis\nthaliana. The experiments highlighted that such tools were able to\noutperform standard statistical approaches. Shaik and Ramakrishna\n(2014) used machine learning techniques to identify multiple stress\nconditions genes for broad resistance in rice, and Behmann et al. (2015)\npresented a review of diﬀerent machine learning techniques applied for\nbiotic stress identiﬁcation in precision crop protection.\nChatterjee et al. (2014) established a relationship between the light\nstimulus and plant electrical response for diﬀerent light stimuli in-\ntensity considering 19 diﬀerent plants (17 Zamioculcas zamiifolia and 2\nCucumis sativus plants). The best results were obtained by Nonlinear\nHammerstein-Wiener (NLHW) a good matching over others ﬁtting\nmethods. Later on, Chatterjee et al. (2015) classiﬁed three diﬀerent\ntypes of stimuli (NaCl, H2SO4 and O3) based on the response of elec-\ntrical signals of tomatoes and cucumbers. The authors used diﬀerent\nmachine learning algorithms (FLDA - Fisher Linear Discriminant Ana-\nlysis, QDA - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, NB - Naive Bayes, and\nMahalanobis Classiﬁer) considering eleven features extracted from the\nelectrical signal using linear and nonlinear methods. The best result was\naround 73.67% of recognition rate.\nChen et al. (2016) applied four classiﬁers (Template Matching, Ar-\ntiﬁcial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Deep Belief\nNetworks) for the recognition of plant stimuli from electrical signals.\nThe aforementioned work combined a waveform-based feature ex-\ntractor and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach, ob-\ntaining around 96% of recognition rate with Template Matching.\nIn this paper, we propose to use the concept of plant electrome\n(Souza et al., 2017) to automatically identify whether diﬀerent en-\nvironmental cues cause speciﬁc changes in the electrical signals of\nsoybean plants. In order to verify such hypothesis, we considered using\nmachine learning algorithms and arithmetic intervalar, a branch of\nmathematical tools that allows one to extend standard numbers to an\ninterval representation. Therefore, the main contributions of this paper\nare:\n• to use the plant electrome data as input for machine learning-based\nprediction of plant stress; and\n• to employ deep learning techniques for plant stress identiﬁcation.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3\npresent the theoretical background and methodology used in this paper,\nas well as the results obtained using the proposed approach, respec-\ntively. Finally, Section 4 states conclusions and future works.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Data acquisition\nAll datasets used herein to test the diﬀerent methods of classiﬁca-\ntion are part of the study published by Souza et al. (2017). The data\nconsist of time series of low-voltage variation ( V\nΔ\nin μV ) measured in\nsoybean plants subjected to diﬀerent environmental stimuli: cold, low\nlight and osmotic stress. The protocol of data acquisition was deﬁned by\nSaraiva et al. (2017), using a signal ampliﬁer (model MP36, Biopac\nSystems, US) inside a grounded Faraday cage. The measurements were\ncarried out with one reference electrode attached to the grounded\nFaraday cage, and two electrodes inserted in the plants operating in a\ndiﬀerential mode, where the instrumental ampliﬁer cuts oﬀthe similar\nfrequencies recorded in both electrodes. The sampling rate was 125 Hz\nwith a high-pass ﬁlter settled to allow pass higher frequencies\n(>0.5 Hz), since the objective of that study was investigate the low-\nvoltage noise that underlies the electrical signals (see more details in\nSaraiva et al. (2017)).\n2.2. Datasets\nThe datasets described in the previous section were cropped to\ncontain features per sample (signals obtained from the plants). Besides\nthe large number of features, the signal is not so homogenous, therefore\napplying classical machine learning methods in the raw data is not\nadvisable. To overcome this weakness, we applied some concepts of\nArithmetic Intervalar to map raw data into lower-dimensional feature\nspace.\nIn our work we consider four diﬀerent datasets, as follows:\n• cold: 67 signals obtained from plants in ideal conditions (without\nstress) and 76 signals obtained after cold stress.\n• low light: 152 signals obtained in ideal conditions (without stress)\nand 118 signals after low light stress.\n• osmotic: 123 signals obtained in ideal conditions (without stress)\nand 145 signals after osmotic stress.\n• all: 342 signals obtained in ideal conditions (without stress), 76\nsignals after cold stress, 118 signals after low light stress, and 145\nsignals obtained after osmotic stress.1\nSome examples of the signals from each class are depicted in Fig. 1.\n2.3. Theoretical background\nIn this section, we present a brief theoretical background related to\nthe machine learning and feature mapping techniques based on Interval\nArithmetic used in this work.\n2.3.1. Interval Arithmetic\nThe Interval Arithmetic (IA) was proposed by Moore in the 1960’s,\nbeing the main idea to represent values as a range model instead of\n1 This dataset is a merge of the cold, low light and osmotic datasets. The main idea of\nthis dataset is to verify whether the methods are able to diﬀerentiate the stress type or\nnot.\nD.R. Pereira et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 145 (2018) 35–42\n36\nsingle numbers. In such representation, an interval I is denoted by an\nnon-empty real-valued range I I\n[ , ]\nl u , such that each interval encodes a\nsubset of real numbers that satisfy the following condition:\n=\n∈\n⩽\n⩽\nI\nx\nI\nx\nI\n{\n|\n}.\nl\nu\nR\n(1)\nAs in the traditional arithmetic, the IA background deﬁnes a set of\nrelations and operations (comparison, join, sum, and multiply) over the\nintervals (Moore, 1966; Moore and Yang, 1959; Moore, 1960, 1962,\n1979). However, the Interval Arithmetic is more powerful than tradi-\ntional arithmetic, since any real number x can be represented by the\nsingular interval x x\n[ , ]. The Interval Arithmetic is a useful apparatus to\nprovide representations of error bounds and uncertainty. This property\nis extremely interesting when working with the variations present in\nthe EEG signals obtained from plants.\n2.3.2. Machine learning techniques\n2.3.2.1. Optimum-Path\nForest. The\nOptimum-Path\nForest\n(OPF)\nclassiﬁer models the problem of pattern recognition as a graph\npartition task, in which a predeﬁned set of samples from each class\n(prototypes) compete for a minimal path-cost attribution to the rest of\nthe samples. Such process results in a collection of optimum-path trees\nrooted at the prototype nodes, building an optimum-path forest\nconsidering from all training samples. Test samples are classiﬁed\nthrough\nincrementally\nevaluating\nthe\noptimum\npaths\nfrom\nthe\nprototypes, as though they were part of the forest, and assigning the\nlabels of the most strongly connected roots. An OPF classiﬁer can be\ndesigned as long as we use a smooth path-cost function (Falcão et al.,\n2004). Although there are two diﬀerent versions of the supervised OPF\nclassiﬁer (Papa et al., 2009, 2017), in this paper we make use of the\nformer and most widely used approach proposed by Papa et al. (2009)\nand further enhanced by Papa et al. (2012). The OPF classiﬁer has been\nused in a number of applications in the last years, and particularly for\nleaf-based aquatic weed recognition (Pereira et al., 2012).\n2.3.2.2. Multilayer\nperceptron. An\nArtiﬁcial\nNeural\nNetwork\nwith\nMultilayer\nPerceptons\n(ANN)\nis\na\nfeedforward\nneural\nnetwork\ncomposed\nof\nseveral\nneuron\nlayers\naiming\nto\nsolve\nmulti-class\nproblems (Haykin, 1999). The input to each layer is a weighted sum\nof the output from the previous layer, and the number of neurons in the\nﬁrst layer is equal to the number of features of the input, while the\nnumber of neurons in the last layer is equal to the number of classes.\nSuch approaches can learn highly non-linear models that map inputs to\ntheir corresponding outputs.\n2.3.2.3. k-Nearest neighbors. The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) is a simple\nbut eﬀective technique that works pretty well in many diﬀerent\napplications (Coomans and Massart, 1982; Hall et al., 2008). In\ncontrast to the OPF, the k-NN uses all training samples as prototypes,\nFig. 1. Exemples of some signals obtained from the plants: (a) ideal condition, (b) after cold stress, (c) after low light, and (d) after osmotic stress.\nD.R. Pereira et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 145 (2018) 35–42\n37\nand requires the input parameter k that establishes the number of\nneighbors that contribute to the classiﬁcation of a given sample. For\nsuch purpose, a given test sample is labeled with the most frequent\nlabel in its k-neighborhood. Notice that for\n=\nk\n1, the testing sample is\nassigned to the class of its closest training sample.\n2.3.2.4. Support Vector Machines. The Support Vector Machines (SVM)\napproach based on the principle of structural risk minimization\n(Vapnik, 1999; Schölkopf and Smola, 2002; Cortes and Vapnik,\n1995), aiming at establishing an optimal discriminative function\namong two classes of patterns while accomplishing the trade-oﬀ\nbetween generalization and overﬁtting. The standard SVM training\nalgorithm constructs the optimal hyperplane separating a two-class\nfeature space (Vapnik, 1999). However, some problems may require a\nmore robust approach. In order to extend from linear to nonlinear\nclassiﬁcation, the kernel trick is used (Schölkopf and Smola, 2002),\nwhere kernel functions nonlinearly map input data into higher-\ndimensional feature spaces in a computationally-eﬃcient manner.\n2.3.2.5. Convolutional\nNeural\nNetworks. Convolutional\nNeural\nNetworks (CNN) are a special type of artiﬁcial neural networks that\nhave been extensively used for unsupervised feature learning (Lecun\net al., 1998). The main idea is to employ several layers of pooling and\nconvolution operators in order to automatically extract features from\ninput data that are invariant to some geometric operations (e.g.,\nrotations and translations).\n2.4. Methodology\nIn this work, we considered two distinct methodologies to learn\nfeatures from the signal extracted from the plants: (i) the ﬁrst one,\nhereinafter called approach A, is based on Interval Arithmetic (IA), and\n(ii) the second approach (approach B) is based on Visual Rhythm and\nCNNs. After extracting features, they are used to feed supervised ma-\nchine learning techniques in order to classify whether the plant has\nbeen aﬀected by stress or not. Fig. 2 illustrates the aforementioned\npipeline. The next sections describe in details the aforementioned ap-\nproaches.\n2.4.1. Approach A\nAs depicted in Fig. 2, approach A aims at decomposing the signal\ninto an intervalar representation based on the theory presented in\nSection 2.3.1. Roughly speaking, the mapping process is straightfor-\nward and window-based. Let\n=\n…\nS\ns s\ns\n{ , , , }\nn\n1\n2\nbe the discrete re-\npresentation of the signal extracted from the soybean, where si stands\nfor an energy acquisition at time step i. Additionally, let s be the\nwindow size, such that the whole signal S is equally divided into\n= ⌊\n⌋\nm\nn s/\nbins\n=\n…\nb k\nm\n,\n1,2, ,\nk\n.\nThe ideia of the intervalar representation is to represent each bin bk\nas a triplet\n=\nT\nmin avg max\n[\n,\n,\n]\nk\nk\nk\nk , where mink and maxk stand for the\nminimum and the maximum values present in bk, and avgk denotes for\nthe average value of the numbers in bk. Therefore, the signal S is ﬁnally\nrepresented as a set of m triplets\n′ =\n…\nS\nmin avg max\nmin avg max\nmin\navg max\n{[\n,\n,\n],[\n,\n,\n], ,[\n,\n,\n]},\nm\nm\nm\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\nwhich is further used to feed the supervised machine learning techni-\nques. Fig. 3 illustrates the aforementioned procedure.\nThe proposed approach reduces considerably the number of features\nthat describe the signal, which aﬀects the computational cost as well.\nWe performed tests with four diﬀerent window sizes, say that\n1000,5000,15,000 and 25,000, being the window size as of 15,000 the one\nthat obtained the best results. Therefore, all experiments were con-\nducted using such conﬁguration. In this context, the number of features\nwere reduced from to 15 (\n=\n75,000/15,000\n5 buckets, being each one\nrepresented by a triplet).\n2.4.2. Approach B\nThe second approach aims at encoding the signal as an image by\nusing the so-called Visual Rhythm (Almeida et al., 2015), which basi-\ncally stacks the signal into rows in order to generate the image.\nFig. 2. Proposed pipeline for automatic plant stress identiﬁcation.\nFig. 3. Approach A used for interval-based signal representation.\nD.R. Pereira et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 145 (2018) 35–42\n38\nTherefore, each signal needs to be normalized into [0,1] for further\nbeing resized into a gray-scale squared matrix. Finally, one obtains a\n×\n273\n273 image, were each signal value denotes a pixel in this image.\nSome examples of images mapped using this methodology are pre-\nsented in Fig. 4. Clearly, one can observe the diﬀerent patterns encoded\nby the images with respect to diﬀerent stress conditions.\nLater on, the images generated using the aforementioned pipeline\nare then employed to feed an CNN technique. In this work, we per-\nformed tests with two diﬀerent classical architectures, as follows:\n• ImageNet: composed of 5 convolution layers, 5 pooling layers and 2\nnormalization layers. It is also constituted by 5 ReLU layers among\nthe convolution ones, 2 inner product layers, 2 dropout layers, 1\nsoftmax loss layer and 1 accuracy layer for testing purposes.\n• Cifar-10: a quick version is used, composed of 3 convolution layers\nand 3 pooling layers. It is also constituted by 3 ReLU layers among\nthe convolution ones, 2 inner product layers, 1 softmax loss layer\nand 1 accuracy layer for testing intentions.\nHowever, as the Cifar-10 model obtained the best results (sig-\nniﬁcantly better than ImageNet), all experiments using CNN were\nrealized using this conﬁguration.\n2.5. Statistical evaluation\nIn regard to the comparison assessment, we used an accuracy\nmeasure proposed by Papa et al. (2009), which is similar to the Kappa\nindex (Cohen, 1960), but being more restrictive. If there are two\nclasses, for example, with very diﬀerent sizes and a classiﬁer always\nassigns the label of the largest class, its accuracy will fall drastically due\nto the high error rate on the smallest class. The accuracy is measured by\ntaking into account the classes may have diﬀerent sizes in the test set.\nAlso, we experiments were executed in 20 runs with diﬀerent training\nand test sets for the further statistical evaluation by means of the Wil-\ncoxon signed-rank test with signiﬁcance of 0.05 (Wilcoxon, 1945).\n2.6. Setting-up machine learning techniques\nWe considered the LibSVM library (Chang and Lin, 2011) for the\nimplementation of SVM classiﬁer. The hyperparameters C and σ were\ndetermined via a 5-fold cross-validation grid-search in the range\n−\n[2\n,2 ]\n15\n15 with steps of 2, for each input parameter.\nWith respect to the ML classiﬁer, we used the Fast Artiﬁcial Neural\nNetwork (FANN) library with two hidden layers consisting of eight\nneurons each (Nissen, 2003). The network was trained using the\nbackpropagation algorithm (Haykin, 1999) with 70,000 epochs and the\ndesired error as of\n−\n10 4. The learning rate was set to 0.1.\nIn regard to k-NN technique, we deﬁned k as the best value of a grid-\nsearch within the range\n⎢⎣⎥⎦\n[1,\n]\nz\n5\nwith steps of two, where z is the number\nof training samples. Finally, with respect to OPF, we used the LibOPF\nlibrary.2\n3. Results\nIn this section, we present the experimental results concerning the\ntask of automatic identifying stress-like patterns before and after stress\nenvironment (i.e., cold, low light and osmotic). As aforementioned, we\napplied ﬁve diﬀerent supervised classiﬁcation algorithms: ANN, CNN,\nOPF, k-NN and SVM. Additionally, we considered the IA mapping ex-\nperiment (procedure A) for ANN, OPF, k-NN, and SVM classiﬁers.\nThe main goal is to ﬁnd an algorithm that can be successfully ap-\nplied to learn a pattern even when trained on small datasets. Therefore,\nwe partitioned the original dataset into training sets of increasing sizes,\nranging from 10% to 90% of the original dataset. For each dataset, we\nexecuted each algorithm 20 times using a holdout conﬁguration. Fig. 5\npresents the results considering the “cold”, “low light”, “osmotic”, and\n“all” datasets, respectively.\nOne can observe that good performances were obtained in the four\ndatasets by all methods, except ANN that achieved the worst results in\n“cold” and “low light” datasets. As expected, all techniques were able to\nimprove their results upon larger training sets, mainly CNNs, which are\ncomplex models and usually need a considerable amount of data for\nleaning (see Fig. 5d). Since “all” dataset comprises all stress-like pat-\nterns (i.e., it seems to pose a greater challenge), CNNs obtained the\nworst results over small training sets.\nTable 1 presents the average results using 90% of the datasets for\ntraining purposes, being the most accurate techniques in bold according\nto the Wilcoxon statistical test. One can observe that SVM obtained the\nbest results for all datasets, followed by k-NN that obtained statistically\nsimilar results in the “cold” and “osmotic” datasets. OPF classiﬁer\nachieved good accuracies for three datasets, and CNN also obtained\ngood results for “cold” and “low light” datasets, although it obtained\nthe worst results for the “osmotic” dataset. Roughly speaking, one can\nobserve that AI combined with supervised classiﬁers can provide better\nresults than deep learning techniques. The recognition rates showed\none can obtain promising results concerning the task of automatically\nidentifying stress-like patterns.\nFig. 6 depicts the confusion matrices using 90% of the datasets for\ntraining purposes with SVM classiﬁer. As one can observe, the signs of\nplants after cold stress have a peculiar pattern that is easier to diﬀer-\nentiate than others stress conditions since it obtained better results.\nAdditionally, the “low light” and “osmotic” datasets presented similar\nresults. The experiment with “all” dataset showed that is possible to\ndetect patterns among diﬀerent stress signals. However, one can ob-\nserve a confusion between “low light” and “no stress” conditions\n(Fig. 6d), which may deteriorate the ﬁnal classiﬁer’s accuracy.\nFig. 4. Some examples of signals mapped into images under: (a) ideal conditions, (b) after cold stress, (c) after low light stress, and (d) after osmotic stress. The images were equalized for\nthe sake of visualization purposes.\n2 https://github.com/jppbsi/LibOPF.\nD.R. Pereira et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 145 (2018) 35–42\n39\n4. Discussion\nDiﬀerent environmental cues, biotic or abiotic, trigger electro-\nphysiological responses in plants, which are basically an ion imbalance\nacross plasma membranes leading to a voltage transient (Maﬀei and\nBossi, 2006; Huber and Bauerle, 2016). While VPs and SPs are mostly\ntriggered by invasive injurious stimuli, such as wounding, APs are eli-\ncited as responses to non-invasive stimuli including irradiation,\nmoisture, and temperature (Fromm and Lautner, 2007; Rìos-Rojas\net al., 2014; Sukhov et al., 2017). Herein, the data analysed were pre-\nvenient from plants subjected to three abiotic stimuli (cold, osmotic,\nand low light) that aﬀected the temporal dynamic of the low-voltage\nsignals (Souza et al., 2017). The measured signals are supposed to be\nthe resultant of all electrical activity of the cells around the electrodes,\nlikely emerging from the superposition of cells APs propagated via\nplasmodesmata linking neighbouring cells (Volkov, 2012; Zimmermann\nand Mithofer, 2013). According to Debono (2013), such microvolted\nactivity represents the resulting macroscopic currents locally sustained\nby plant receptor-channels acting through the diﬀerent membrane\ncompartments of synchronized protoneural networks, which was\nnamed “plant electrome” by Souza et al. (2017).\nThe previous spectral analysis (Souza et al., 2017) showed that\nbefore stimuli the runs exhibited three ranges of dominant frequencies\n(0.3–1.5, 3.8–5.7, and 9.3–11.1 Hz) and, after stimuli, only the lower\nfrequencies remained. The β exponents calculated from power spec-\ntrum density function indicated that all time series showed long-range\ntemporal correlation. However, β values from non-stimulated plants\nwere lower, suggesting that the electrical signalling after plant stimu-\nlation showed more persistence (for\n≠\nβ\n0 and\n≠\nβ\n2), enabling long\ndistance signalling (Souza et al., 2017). Besides some changes in the\ntype of noise (reddened to black) and in the spectral analysis, it was\nobserved an interesting appearance of “bursts of spikes” up to 500 μV\n(considering the baseline signal around 10 μV) mostly in the runs\nscored after stimuli. The distribution of these higher voltage variations\nwas diﬀerent regarding the speciﬁc stimuli. While the spikes observed\nunder low temperature showed an exponential distribution, under low\nlight and, mainly, under osmotic stimulus they followed a power law,\nindicating that the spikes have no characteristic size (Souza et al.,\n2017). Those bursts of spikes were supposed as resulting from a self-\norganized collective behaviour among groups of cells Saraiva et al.\n(2017). The complex nature of these microvolted potential and their\ncoherent responses to environmental cues suggests that\n+\nH electrogenic\npumps, and others ionic receptors channels (e.g.\n+\nCa2\nand\n+\nK1 ), are\ninvolved in such responses (Debono, 2013). Following a membrane\nelectrical event, secondary messengers are initiated, leading to a\ndownstream signalling cascade that induce many diﬀerent metabolic\nchanges, likely mediated by calcium waves and ROS (Maﬀei et al.,\n2007; Gilroy et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016). Evidences have indicated\nFig. 5.

Pereira et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 145 (2018) 35–42\n40\nthat electrical signalling regulates a fundamental physiological process,\nthe well-known photosynthesis. Although the mechanisms of photo-\nsynthetic activation are still unclear, two diﬀerent mechanisms have\nbeen proposed for the fast inactivation of photosynthesis. The ﬁrst is\ncalcium dependent, in which the increase of\n+\nCa2\ncytosolic can in-\nactivate the Calvin-Benson cycle; and the second supposes that elec-\ntrical activity changes the intra- and extracellular pH, decreasing the\ncytoplasmic pH by inactivation of H+-ATPase, which reduces the\nphotochemical yields (Sukhov, 2016).\nAccordingly, our hypothesis is that the low voltage variations af-\nfected by diﬀerent abiotic stimuli could be representative of the elec-\ntrophysiological state of the plants as aﬀected by speciﬁc stimulus al-\nlowing an algorithmic classiﬁcation. In this work, we introduced two\ndiﬀerent methods for the automatic classiﬁcation of plant stress based\non the plant electrome. The ﬁrst approach makes use of Interval\nArithmetic to reduce the dimensionality of the input signal, and the\nsecond one employs deep learning for unsupervised feature learning.\nChen et al. (2016) have studied the eﬃciency of some deep learning\nmethods, such as ANN and SVM, comparing with template matching\nmethod to classify APs. In that study, after the elimination of some\nartifacts present in the raw signals, they extracted 19 features from the\nAP’s\nsignals,\nincluding\ntime-domain,\nfrequency-domain,\nstatistics\ncharacteristics, and nonlinear features. Then, by reducing the di-\nmensionality with PCA, the diﬀerent classiﬁers were tested against non-\nAP signals. Although the best performance have been reached with\ntemplate matching algorithm (96.0% accuracy), ANN and SVM reached\na maximum accuracy of 84.1% and 75.8%, respectively, which is pretty\nclose to our best results (Table 1). However, diﬀerently from Chen et al.\n(2016) study, our classiﬁcation algorithms were applied to, basically,\ncontinuous time series of raw data of low voltage variation, showing\nvery complex dynamics (Saraiva et al., 2017; Souza et al., 2017).\nChatterjee et al. (2015) have explored strategies for the classiﬁcation of\nraw non-stationary plant electrical signal after diﬀerent environmental\nstimuli (mV) by univariate and bivariate feature-based classiﬁcation\nusing ﬁve diﬀerent discriminant analysis classiﬁers. The classiﬁcation\nhas reached a best average accuracy of 70% using variance and skew-\nness as feature pairs, and an accuracy of 73.67% using variance and IQR\nas feature pairs in a diagquadratic classiﬁer. Thus, as far as we know,\nthis is the ﬁrst time that microvolted runs are classiﬁed by machine\nlearning techniques.\n5. Conclusions\nThe\nproposed\napproaches\nherein\nachieved\nsurprisingly\ngood\nFig. 6.

The experiments also\nsuggested that Interval Arithmetic and supervised classiﬁers are more\nsuitable than deep learning. Such achievement is very important since\nthe plant stress could be identiﬁed before the plant has demonstrated\nphysical injuries, such as leaf fall, and decreased productivity, among\nother factors. Our future works will be guided to develop better models\nthat can distinguish all three stressful conditions at the same time.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to FAPESP grants #2013/07375-0, #2014/\n16250-9, #2014/12236-1, and #2016/19403-6, as well as CNPq grant\n#306166/2014-3.\nAppendix A.

Adequate nutrition of plants signifies their role in the growth and a plentiful harvest. Plant signal data \ncarries enough information to detect and analyse nutrient deficiency. Classification of nutrient deficiencies \nthrough signal decomposition and bilevel measurements has not been reported earlier. The proposed work ex­\nplores tomato plants in four-time cycles (Early Morning, Morning, After Noon, Night) of macronutrients Calcium \n(Ca), Nitrogen (N) and micronutrients Manganese (Mn), Iron (Fe). Using the Empirical Mode Decomposition \nmethod (EMD), signals are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) in 10-levels. Further, Intrinsic mode \nfunctions are grouped into two clusters to extract descriptive data statistics and bi-level measurements. Then a \nnovel sample selection method is proposed to achieve a better classification rate by reducing sample space. A \nbinary classification model is built to train and test 15 features individually using discriminant analysis and \nnaïve-Bayes classifier variants. The reported results achieved a classification rate up to 98% after 5-fold cross- \nvalidation. Attained findings endorse novel pathways for detection and classification of nutrient deficiencies \nin the early stages, consequently promoting prevention and treatment approaches earliest to the appearance of \nsymptoms, also helping to enhance plant growth.   \n1. Introduction \nAgriculture plays a primary role in our healthy sustenance. A healthy \ncrop is dominantly vital to farmers. Plant fitness affects total yield \ndrastically. Agricultural productivity is driven by innovative scientific \ngrounds using data-intense methods and digital agriculture (Liakos \net al., 2018). To increase productivity, many organisations across the \nglobe continuously monitor plants to prevent diseases and deficiencies. \nSuch monitoring systems present esteemed real-time information that \ncan be used to identify stress undergone by plants and control the factors \nof causation. Many organisations employ monitoring systems to sense \nmultiple environmental parameters. They possess complex infrastruc­\nture, are cost exclusive, and are confined to a certain terrestrial area. An \nelectrophysiological signal monitoring system justifies all aspects \n(Chatterjee et al., 2018). Electrical signals of plants convey a proportion \nof information about undergoing plant state more likely to cardiogram \nsignals in humans. The high sensitivity of protoplasm and cell organelles \ndisturbs the steady-state electrical activity of plants when they experi­\nence natural and electrochemical changes in the environment. Due to \nnon-living factors like extreme temperatures, overwatering, nutrient \ndeficiencies, etc., the changes in plant activity are termed abiotic stress \n(Zhang et al., 2022; Cramer et al., 2011). Action potential, variation \npotential and resting potential are three different potentials observed in \nplants. The potentials of plants vary at different times of the day; \ntherefore, analysing them periodically is substantial. So forth, any stress \nin plants has an unsympathetic effect on physiology(Fromm et al., 2013; \nFromm and Lautner, 2007). Many researchers focussed on amplitude, \nfrequency, potential difference and direction of propagation of electrical \nsignals in plants (Dziubinska et al., 2003; Stahlberg et al., 1997). \nHowever, present studies must understand complex signalling mecha­\nnisms involved in plant physiological processes from cell to plant level \n(Hedrich et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018). The adverse effects on the \nphysiology of the plant show transitions in acquired electrical signals. \nPlants acquire the essential components and nutrients from the soil \nthrough various signaling pathways by translocating ions. Ion trans­\nlocation, cell membranes, and inter-cell communication are the key \naspects to maintain the electrical signal potential values and shape. \nIntra-cellular \ncalcium \nvariations \nof \nepithelial \ncells, \nchloride \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail addresses: kavyasai.ece@gmail.com, kavyasy.ec.17@nitj.ac.in (K.

Membrane \npotentials are the major regulator of continuous wave rhythms in plants \n(Damineli et al., 2022). Plant electrophysiological signal phenotype is \nconsidered as an interdisciplinary prospective where efficient aggrega­\ntion of signals contain numerous information about plants (Li et al., \n2021). Numerous factors influence plant physiology, but nutrient defi­\nciency is one of the major factors. Nutritional deficiencies in plants do \nnot trigger an instant stimulus that provokes a sharp burst of spikes in \nthe plant electrical activity like other stresses. Unlike sharp shooting \nchanges in potentials the variation in charge concentration during \nhealthy and deficiency states of plant are varied in a gradual manner. \nChange in charge concentration helps to identify and detect nutrient \ndeficiencies in plants. Various types of potentials depicted by the elec­\ntrophysiological signals of plants are solely dependent on the charge \nconcentration of ions present in the plant. The quantity of the ions \nabsorbed by the plant depends on the magnitude and shape of the \nelectrical conductivity curves (Bodale et al., 2021). Plants need nutrients \nto grow and maintain their optimal health. They need larger amounts of \nnitrogen, calcium, potassium and magnesium etc., in large amounts and \nare termed macronutrients. Also, micronutrients like iron, manganese, \nmolybdenum and zinc etc., in smaller amounts, maintain balanced \nnutrition (H¨ansch and Mendel, 2009). Utmost nutrient deficiencies \noccur due to a lack of nutrient content in the growing medium. Detecting \nand treating nutrient deficiency in the plant is more vital since it impacts \nthe natural ability of fruiting and flowering in plants (Maia et al., 2019; \nKalaji et al., 2014). Tomato plants need macronutrients Ca and N in \nlarger amounts for healthy growth. Ca deficiency in tomato plants shows \nthe major symptom of necrosis in the base of leaves and end rot in to­\nmatoes. Poor translocation of Ca ions along the signalling pathways in \nchronic cases makes the plants wilt even. In N deficiency, tomato plants \nexhibited yellowing of leaves and terminated branching. Similarly, \nmicronutrients like Fe and Mn also play a crucial in tomato plants. The \ndeficiency of these nutrients in tomato plants exhibits intervening \nchlorosis. Since Fe has low ion translocation youngest leaves are fore­\nmost affected (Reissig, Oliveira, Costa, et al., 2021). Every nutrient, \neither macro or micro, tends to play its role to help in plant processes. \nTherefore, early diagnosis of nutrient imbalances is a key for farmers to \nincrease the yield. Rendering to present-day plant signal analysis takes a \npath in both Time Domain and Frequency Domain. Signals in TD show a \ngraph of amplitude varying concerning time. Analyses in this domain \ninvolve computation of statistical features (mean, standard deviation \netc., signal variation dynamics (peak value, root mean square, shape \nfactor etc.) and bilevel dynamics (rise time, fall time, peak time etc.). \nFrequency domain analysis involves spectral analysis by computing Fast \nFourier Transform (FFT), Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) etc. \n(Hovanessian, 1975). This article presents a time-domain analysis of \nsignals before employing machine learning methods. Machine learning \nhas become a leading definition to understand many plant processes \nthrough big data analysis and high-performance computing. ML meth­\nodologies involve a learning process (learn from an event or experi­\nence/get trained) to perform a new task. Plant electrical signals \ngenerally possess numeric values (of amplitude), easily computed into a \nset of attributes known as features or variables. The classifier learns \nthese features concerning the target (output) class and then tests to \nperform classification according to learned data. The ML model’s per­\nformance for a specific task is then computed through performance \nmetrics like accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, etc. (Maione and \nBarbosa, 2019). In humans and animals, analysing the temporal dy­\nnamics of electrical activity is done to diagnose one’s health. Similarly, \nthe study of plant electrical activity to distinguish plant processes makes \na step forward to develop the physiological status of plants and, \nconsequently, expand paths into broader research areas. In this article, \nthe presented work explores the possibility of classifying nutrient \ndeficiencies (Ca, N, Fe, Mn) in tomato plants through signal decompo­\nsition followed by feature extraction and sample selection. Binary clas­\nsification is performed through QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis), \nESD (Ensemble Subspace Discriminant), KNB (Kernel Naïve Bayes) and \nGNB (Gaussian Navie Bayes) classifiers using descriptive data statistics \nand bilevel measurements as features discretely. \nThe total work presented in this study is organised into various \nsections. Section 2 explains the methodology proposed to prepare data \nfor classification to achieve a better classification rate. Section 3 shows \nresults obtained to classify nutrient deficiencies, and section 4 implies \nrespective discussion and comparison. Lastly, section 5 states conclu­\nsions drawn from accomplished work. \n2. Material and methods \n2.1. Database \nThe current study carried out analysis and classification on the da­\ntabases of 15 tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. The experiments \nfor creating Fe, Ca, Mn and N nutrient deficiencies were conducted at the \nAgroscope research station (Conthey, Switzerland) and all rights remain \nwith Vivent SA. \n2.1.1. Plant growth conditions \nFifteen tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) of 5 months old and 4 \nm high were grown on organic blocks possessing compost of bark (35%), \na peat substitute (30%), coco peat (20%) and topsoil (15%) (Substrate \n127, Ricoter, CH) located on hanging and elevated troughs. Plants were \ncultivated with two-truss with a planting density of 3.8 truss per m2 \n(Tran and Camps, 2021). \n2.1.2. Plant nutrition experiment description \nAll Plants were irrigated with nutrients and water through drippers. \nOf 15 plants, three plants were provided with standard optimised \nnutrient solution used to grow tomatoes at Agroscope and are consid­\nered healthy. It is presented that 3 plants were considered for Fe defi­\nciency experiments, where Fe was explicitly removed from premixed \nnutrients solution before data acquisition (Tran and Camps, 2021). \nSimilarly, for experiments of Ca, Mn and N deficiencies, Agroscope \nremoved specific compounds from the solution and continued to grow \nthe tomatoes under normal conditions until visual symptoms of the \nspecific deficit were clearly evident. \n2.1.3. Signal acquisition and data grouping \nElectrical signals produced by plants have been recorded using an 8 \nchannel PhytlSigns devices from Vivent SA, as described in (Tran et al., \n2019). The device is designed to have high impedence in MΩ. The \nelectrodes used in these experiments are made of 0.5 mm silver-coated \ncopper wire covered with 2.79 mm diameter coaxial cable. Two inser­\ntion electrodes were positioned on main stem and leaf petiole and the \npotential difference between the electrodes is recorded in form of a \ncontinuous electrical signal for 3 weeks for all 15 plants. The signals thus \nrecorded are sampled at 500Hz, and powerline interference is substan­\ntiated by applying a notch filter at 50Hz and 100Hz. The signal’s \namplitude is quantified in mV (millivolts) as a function of time. The \ndatabase is customised using Matlab software (Matlab, R2020a)(Tran \nand Camps, 2021). \nThe database considered in this study comprises signals from tomato \nplants in healthy and nutrient deficit conditions (earliest stages of \nsymptom appearance) comprised of 43,200,000 samples each (Recorded \nfor 24 h from 12 a.m.12 p.m.). This huge amount of data makes the study \ncomplex, and therefore, data is processed in four batches. The timings \nconsidered for analysis have no physiological significance, random time \nperiods from four different parts of day are opted since the plant po­\ntentials vary with different fundamental processes throughout day and \nnight. Data chunks of 18,00,000 samples, representing four different \nK. Sai et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nPlant Physiology and Biochemistry 186 (2022) 266–278\n268\ntimes of the 24 h, are analyzed separately in batches as grouped below.  \n• Batch1 - Early morning (1am–2am)  \n• Batch2 - Morning (7am–8am)  \n• Batch3 - Noon (1pm–2pm)  \n• Batch4 - Evening (7pm–8pm) \nClassifier performance evaluation using machine learning algorithms \nto detect plant state (healthy or deficit) for four batches is made \ndistinctly. \n2.2. Electrophysiology description \nPrevious biomedical studies describe that the pulse rate or respira­\ntion rate of human beings differs with age, physical activity, food habits \netc. Similarly, not every plant possesses the same potential charge \nconcentration even if they belong to the same age, same soil are and \ngrown in the same climatic conditions. The charge concentration or \npotentials of plants depend on the uptake of nutrition and ion trans­\nlocation. Table 1 shows the information of nutrients considered in this \nstudy and their sample potential values obtained during healthy and \ndeficient states. Observations in the table illustrated that ion concen­\ntration in plant 1, during normal state is −77 and increased to −175 \nduring Ca deficiency state, since the Ca is a positive polarity ion. Positive \npolarity ions decrement increased the negative charge concentration \ninside or outside the cells. Similar observations for other nutrients depict \nthat the polarity and potential changes depend on type of deficiency and \nstrength of deficiency. Featuring the differences in these potentials at \nregular time instants may provide a detailed analysis to better under­\nstand nutrient deficiencies which are still in the infant phase. Analysis of \ncombined nutrient deficiency stresses through electrophysiology would \nlay further paths. However, in this study it is considered to decompose \nsignals in 10 different levels to analyse features. \n2.3. Methodology \nIn this study, a step-by-step procedure is developed to classify the \nhealthy and deficit states of the tomato plant, as shown in Fig. 1. The \nprimary stages involved data pre-processing, signal decomposition and \ngrouping of decomposed signal values. The ranges of a decomposed \nsignal are visualized through boxplots. The later stages comprised \nfeature extraction, sample selection and classification. \n2.3.1. Data pre-processing \nThe current study processes 18,00,000 samples in four different \nbatches, where the initial phase of pre-processing involves checking for \nmissing outlier values and noise artefacts. Outlier values are processed \nby the moving mean method, in which outliers are replaced by the mean \nvalue obtained from pre and post samples (3 previous, 3 post) of that \nparticular outlier. A third-order one-dimensional median filter is used to \nremove noise due to drift. Since the database is processed for powerline \ninterference and noise artefacts, as mentioned earlier in (Tran et al., \n2019), repetition is insignificant in this study. \n2.3.2. Signal decomposition \nSignal decomposition is the standard method adopted to analyse \nbiological signals like electrocardiographs and electroencephalograms. \nIt is an effective tool to recognize and characterise modal information \npresent in the time-domain signal. The decomposition principle is \nshouldered on the assumption that the signal consists of different \nintrinsic modes oscillating in it (S¨ornmo and Laguna, 2005). The method \nadopted to decompose the signal of tomato plants in this study is EMD. \nEMD is a technique of splitting non-linear and non-stationary signals \ninto evocative physical components at various resolutions. The signal is \ndecomposed into a finite number of IMFs (Intrinsic mode functions) of \ninstantaneous frequencies as time-generous functions, which are \nabruptly identified in embedded formations. This decomposition \nmethod is older but has higher efficiency in portraying the information \npresent in the signal (Zeiler et al., 2010). For illustration purposes, the \nplant signal is assumed as S(t). To extract IMFs through EMD, the os­\ncillations of signal S(t) considered at two consecutive extremes (local \nminima) defines high-frequency IMF, let min(t), t1≤t ≤t2. The low \nfrequency IMF is then obtained from max(t) = s(t) – min(t) for t1≤t ≤\nt2. This is performed for all oscillations composing the entire signal \n(Zhang et al., 2021). Therefore, noticeably described in the following \nsteps: \nFor a signal S(t).  \n1. Identifying all extremes of S(t).  \n2. Interpolating between all minima, obtaining an envelope min(t).  \n3. Interpolating between all maxima, obtaining an envelope max(t).  \n4. Computing mean of minima and maxima mean(t) = (min(t)+max \n(t))/2.  \n5. Extracting the details of signal D(t) = S(t) – mean(t).  \n6. Iterating on the residual mean (t) until the mean becomes zero. \nFor 18,00,000 samples of signal in a healthy state and deficit state, \nten10 different IMFs each were obtained. The decomposition performed \nby EMD for batch1 samples in healthy and Ca nutrient deficiency cases \nwere plotted in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. To demonstrate good visualisations, \nplots are depicted lone for 10000 samples. It is observed from Figs. 2 and \n3 every iteration creates a new IMF with decreased mean. Signals of four \nbatches in both healthy and deficiency states were decomposed through \nEMD before grouping to extract features. \n2.3.3. IMF grouping \nThe IMF is a function having an equal number of maxima and zero \ncrossings whose envelopes are symmetric concerning zero. An IMF is \nformed by satisfying two conditions:  \n1.

The local maximum is specified by the mean value at any point, and \nthe local minimum is zero. \nAn IMF is also known as a well-behaved Hilbert Transform(Tanaka \nand Mandic, 2007; Rilling et al., 2007).

Therefore, to contemplate this study, IMF \ngrouping is preferred. IMF 1 – IMF 5 describe high-frequency variables \ncategorized into one group, and IMF 6 – IMF 10 depict frequency vari­\nables as another group. To develop a classification model and choose the \nclassifiers that best perform classification, the potential ranges of all \nIMFs in healthy and nutrient deficient cases in 4 batches were verified \nand depicted in boxplots.

The ranges portrayed by each IMF in boxplots have \ngiven a pathway to elect features that better designate both groups. \nPotential ranges of IMFs in all batches are shown in Figs. 4–7. \n2.3.4. Feature extraction \nHere, 8 data descriptive statistical measurements and 7 bi-level \nmeasurements predominantly used to study other biological signals \nwere considered as features. Different descriptive features like mean \n(F1), shape factor (F2), peak to peak (F3), crest factor (F4), impulse \nfactor (F5), average slew rate (F6), average mid-cross (F7), peak value \n(F8) and are computed from formulae described in Table 2. Mean is \ncomputed by a standard method where x(t) denotes the signal amplitude \nat time instant t, a and b are lower and upper limits of sample values at a \nrespective time instant. The shape factor is the root mean square value \nratio to the mean value. Peak to peak is the difference between \nmaximum and minimum peak values along the length of the vector. The \ncrest factor is the ratio of peak value to root mean square. The impulse \nfactor is ratio of peak value to mean value. Slew rate is the rate of change \nthat occurred in signal amplitude from 10% to 90% concerning two \nconsecutive time instants. Mid-cross is a time instant where each tran­\nsition crosses 50% of the reference level. \nBi-level measurements like peak time (F9), average fall time (F10), \naverage rise time (F11), settling minimum (F12), settling maximum \n(F13), overshoot (F14) and undershoot (F15) were computed from step \nresponse characteristics as shown in Fig. 8. Time taken for the response \nto rise from 10% to 90% of its -state is termed as rise time and respective \npotential is noted as peak value. The time at which peak value occurs is \nnoted as peak time. The percentage at which response shoots above the \nfinal value is overshoot, and that below the initial value is undershoot. \nTime taken for steady state response to settle within 2% of final value is \nsettling time. After the response has risen, the maximum value depicts \nthe settling maximum and the minimum value depicts the settling \nminimum. For a deep understanding of step-response features, Fig. 8 has \nan illustrative description showing features F9–F15. As discussed in \n2.2.3, all 10 IMFs were parted into two groups, and the sample range \nincreases five times i.e., 16,00,000 × 5 = 80,00,000,. Features were \ncomputed for every 2000 sample period (80,00,000/2000 = ,4000) \nforming a feature matrix of 4000 × 15. Two feature matrices of extracted \nfeatures were obtained in the normal and deficit cases. \n2.3.5. Sample selection \nSample selection is made by obtaining difference matrices and \nselecting maximum diverged values without repetition. This approach of \nanalysis has boosted classification accuracies since maximum differed \nsamples from the normal and ideal cases are being selected. The selec­\ntion method is proposed by differencing every sample of the normal \nmatrix (N) with all samples of the deficit matrix (D). \nTo illustrate, later feature extraction two feature matrices in normal \nand deficit cases were obtained. A total of 15 features with 4000 samples \nare extracted in a 4000 × 15 matrix from both cases, as shown in Fig. 9. \nDifference matrix is obtained from each feature separately as D1 = N \n(F1) – [S(F1)] T, D2 = N(F2) – [S(F2)] T … …. D15 = N(F15) – [S(F15)]T \nrespectively where size of each difference matrix is 4000 × 4000. \nTherefore, the maximum values from each column of the difference \nmatrix are nominated without repetition. Respective samples from N \nand D which gave maximum difference were selected for classification \npurpose where feature space is reduced. \n2.3.6. Classification \nA binary classification scheme is adopted to classify 15 features \nindividually in all nutrient deficiency cases. The principle of binary \nclassification is to classify total given data into two groups (normal class, \ndeficit class) based on the classification rule. To compensate the vari­\nability both feature matrices were normalized by using logarithmic \ntransformation. \nA preliminary investigation using Discriminant analysis and Naïve \nbayes classifiers has shown good performance metrics than Decision \ntrees, logistic regression, and K nearest neighbor classifiers. Therefore, \nthis study chooses QDA, ESD, KNB and GNB classifiers for computing \nresults. The discussion about classifier performances and classification \nrates to early detect nutrient deficiencies in plants was made in the re­\nsults section. QDA classifier separates two classes by computing \ncovariance matrices of each class. A second-order hyperplane is \nFig. 4.

Sai et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nPlant Physiology and Biochemistry 186 (2022) 266–278\n271\nconstructed to distinguish two classes (Wu et al., 1996; Aoshima and \nYata, 2019). GNB classifier works with an assumption that data in each \nclass are normally distributed where the maximum probability instance \ndefines the class value (Jahromi and Taheri, 2017). KNB classifier uses \nkernel density of continuous variable estimated by means of different \nkernels. A kernel is a weight function through which densities are esti­\nmated (P´erez et al., 2009). ESD classifier makes a random selection of \nsamples to create subspaces and voting for majority discrimination \n(between the subspaces) is chosen to build a model. Classifier perfor­\nmance is proportional to the number of samples. The sample selection \nmethod proposed in this article has boosted the classifier performance. \n3. Results \nObservations of decomposed signals led to examine that \nclassification of nutrient deficiency in signal data when split into \ndifferent resolutions may perhaps show a distinctive performance. As \ndiscussed in earlier sections methodology followed a step-by-step pro­\ncedure to investigate signals and decide the probable method for clas­\nsification with respect to data variations. \nModels for distinguishing normal and deficit data in four different \nbatches were built with equal distribution of two classes after sample \nselection. The mean absolute deviation of classification accuracies ob­\ntained from four batches individually are anticipated in tabular forms. \nThe results describing the performance of each classifier to evaluate \nnutrient deficiency from a normal state are shown in Tables 2–5. As per \nTable 3, features F2, F7 and F9 contributed a discriminant performance \nto classify Ca nutrient deficiency. Also from Table 3, it is observed that \nF11, F12 and F15 when independently considered for classification have \nshown accuracies up to 70% which is considered as the smallest \nFig. 5.

It is noticed that QDA \nand ESD classifiers have differences in accuracies between two groups \n(IMF1-5 and IMF6-10) greater than 5% for features F1, F3, F4, F6, F11, \nand F15 asserting that these data descriptive statistics in case of two \ngroups of Ca nutrient deficiency have maximum variation. Parting into a \ngreater number of groups for these particular features gives better re­\nsults. Lingering features in Table 3 have contributed their best to classify \ndeficiency from the normal state. Table 4 contains the performance \nmetrics for classifying Fe deficiency from the normal state, where fea­\ntures F3, F6, and F15 showing accuracies of around 70% are considered \nas minimally contributed. As previously discussed in the case of Ca, \nfeatures F7 and F9 have countersigned best classification performance to \nevaluate Fe nutrient deficiency as well. Also from Table 4, it is noted that \nfeatures F1, F3 and F6 have shown greater deviations in various classi­\nfiers sustaining incompatibility to mixed data or long-term continuous \ndata. Features F2, F7, F9 from Table 3 and F7, F9 from Table 4 have \nshown minimum mean deviations which are less than 1%. F3, F4, F6 and \nF15 features have obtained differences in accuracies in two groups \n(IMF1-5 and IMF6-10) greater than 10% by QDA, GNB and ESD \nclassifiers. \nAlso, F15 have attained a greater difference among all classifiers. As \ndiscussed above in the case of Ca nutrient deficiency, grouping gives a \nbetter solution to obtain the best accuracies from maximum features. \nThe performance metrics obtained after the classification of Mn defi­\nciency from the normal state are noted in Table 5, where features F2 and \nF9 contributed greater classification accuracies up to 99%. F3, F4, F10, \nF14 and F15 obtained accuracies of around 85% showing moderate re­\nsults when individual features are considered. The mean absolute de­\nviations of F3 and F4 features in some classifier performances were \ngreater than 5%. F1, F2, F7, F9 and F15 features have minimum mean \ndeviations i.e., less than 1% and consistent accuracies to explain the \nbetter performance of various classifiers.

In Table 6, the accuracies \nobtained from the classification of N nutrient deficiency from the normal \nstate through various classifiers were stated. Features F2, F7 and F9 have \nachieved a greater classification rate up to 99%.

Similarly, parts (b), (c) and (d) show line plots \nof accuracies obtained by respective features using KNB, GNB and ESD \nclassifiers. The accuracies plotted against features were average accu­\nracies obtained from two groups (IMF1-5, IMF6-10). Observations from \nthe plots demonstrate sharp-pointed peaks for features F2 and F9 in all \nclassifier models for all nutrients. There is a simultaneous sharp rise at \nF2, F5, F7 and F9 forming peaks in line plots describing QDA and KNB \nclassifier performances. Ca nutrient has shown a sharp down peak at \nfeatures F12, and F15 in all classifier plots and therefore more prone to \npoor classification performance. Among all the classifiers, ESD depicted \na greater number of sharp down peaks as illustrated in Fig. 10(d). As \ndiscussed earlier, F2 and F9 show good performance metrics and F12, \nand F15 are categorized as poor performing features. Similarly, no \nnoticeable new features were categorized by plotting the mean accu­\nracies of the two groups. Suggestively, the classifiers that are able to \ndistinguish a deficiency state from a normal state with an accuracy of \naround 90% are promotable. \nFurthermore, the performance of four classifiers is compared for four \nnutrients independently. Line graphs of accuracies obtained by various \nclassifiers with respect to features are plotted and visualized in Fig. 11. \nDifferent colours in the graph distinguish various classifiers labelled in \nthe plot. Part (a) of Fig. 11 illustrates the plot of accuracies obtained by \nrespective features using all classifiers to distinguish Ca Nutrient defi­\nciency samples from normal samples. Similarly, parts (b), (c) and (d) \ndescribe classifier comparison for Fe, Mn and N nutrients. Part (b) and \n(d) of Fig. 11 portrayed a dense line plot describing that all classifiers \ndepicted closer classification rates with minimum deviations. In the case \nof Mn, QDA and KNB classifiers showed similar results whereby GNB \nand ESD represented a maximum deviation greater than 10% for some \nfeatures. Sharp down peaks illustrated in Fig. 11(c) to distinguish Mn \nnutrient deficiency are more in number when compared to other nu­\ntrients Ca, Fe and N. Line plots describing classifier performance of Ca \nare dense for all features except F3, F4, F12, F13 and F15. The simul­\ntaneous high densities in graphs demonstrate that four classifiers opted \nto build classification models that were justified according to data. \nOverall, the four classifiers in the case of Ca, Fe and N have evidenced \ndelightful results but the unsatisfactory performance of ESD limiting \nsome features in the case of Mn nutrient is exceptional and can be \nnegotiated. \nThe comprehensive results showed that F2, F7 and F9 features \nclassified all nutrient deficiencies at the best level. These two features \nare valuable for discriminating the state of the plant. Lingering features \nexcept F15 have depicted accuracies around 85%–95% with respect to \nthe classifier learning rate. All classification models are built at a \nlearning rate of 0.8% with 80% as training data and 20% as testing data. \nKNB and GNB classifiers use kernel and gaussian distributions for den­\nsity estimation since the data is continuous. QDA classifier trains data by \ncalculating the mean and covariance of respective sets of classes. All the \naccuracies portrayed were average accuracies after 5-fold cross- \nvalidation. \nThe metrics portrayed in Table 7 demonstrate that the GNB classifier \nhas shown sophisticated performance in classification. 13 out of 15 \nfeatures have attained the best classification rate through GNB classifier \nin all nutrient deficit cases. As discussed earlier, features F2 (shape \nfactor), F7(average mid-cross) and F9 (peak time) achieved average \naccuracy up to 98% and are considered proficient features. \n4. Discussion \nIt is insightful that signal decomposition provided a sharp con­\nstruction of a database to evaluate minute variations in potentials of \ndeficit state from normal state acquiring accuracies up to 98%.

The \nresearch attempted to build various computational models to classify the \nhealthy and stressed plants are shown in Table 8. The authors predicted \nthe intensity of light through regression analysis of time-series signals. \nRising and falling edges of light are successfully predicted through \nLinear Time-Invariant (LTI) discrete-time estimators like Least squares \nEstimator (LSE), Auto-Regressive eXogeneous (ARX), Auto Regressive \nMoving Average eXogeneous (ARMAX), Box Jenkins (BJ), Output Error \n(OE) and non-linear time series estimators like Non-Linear ARX \n(NLARX), Non-Linear Hammerstein Winner (NLHW) (Chatterjee et al., \n2014). Apart from statistical features analysis, signal processing \nmethods lingered better in distinguishing the state of the plant by giving \nmotivation to this study. \nChatterjee et al. presented classification and analysis based on sta­\ntionary and non-stationary behaviour of tomato plant signals by \nextracting statistical features using two classification strategies one- \nversus-one (OVO), one-versus-rest (OVR) to classify chemically treated \nplants. Also, one more related work presented curve-fitting models to \nclassify the same. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), QDA, Diaglinear, \nDiagquadratic and Mahalanobis classifiers are considered for classifi­\ncation reported in both works (Chatterjee et al., 2015, 2017). These \nfindings helped to predict that improved results can be obtained by \nanalysing plant states in different groups. With the assessment of \ndifferent noticeable changes in IMFs, the current study priorly evaluated \nresults by forming several groups which intended a broader study in \nevery nutrient deficit case. Hence, this study ended up in 2 groups, \nwhere it can be further studied with minimal databases. \nElectrically stimulated cucumber plant potentials were classified by \nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN) which gave an accuracy of 84.8%, \nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) with the accuracy of 78.2% and deep \nlearning method 77.4%, nevertheless this research promoted a Template \nMatching (TM) algorithm which achieved a classification rate of 96.0% \n(Chen et al., 2016a). These findings implied to recognize and extracting \nsimilar waveforms of action potential and matching templates to classify \nwaveforms obtained by electrical stimulation. Spectral analysis by Fast \nFourier Transform (FFT) and Power-Spectral Density (PSD) analysis is \nperformed on signals from 15 days old soybean seedlings where \ntime-based sequential dynamics have shown the multifarious non-linear \nbehaviour with the long-range persistence. Machine learning algorithms \n(ANN, Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Optimum-Path Forest \n(OPF), K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and SVM) together with Interval \nArithmetic are implemented to classify cold, osmotic and lowlight stress \nin soybean signals where 70% accuracy is obtained using skewness, \nvariance as feature pairs and 73.67% accuracy using IQR and variance as \nfeature pairs (Souza et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2018a). These works \nportrayed that using different window lengths affects the classification \nrate and grouping of features enhances the performance of the classifier \nbased on the size of the data. Features extracted in this study are \nFig. 11.

This article \npresented noticeable and applicable range variations during different \ntimes of the day (Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, Evening visual­\nized box plots. Further investigation is needed to better understand \ndeficiency variations during different times of the day. \nAlso, the authors presented that tomato plants, when endured with \ndrought stress GBT, acquired the best classification accuracy of 98.5% \nand precision of 99.3% (Tran et al., 2019). Some works reported sta­\ntistical, wavelet decomposition and noise colour estimation features are \nobtained from signals acquired from 12 tomato plants infested with \nspider mites, where the GBT algorithm proficiently classified normal and \ninfested states with accuracies of 80% in day samples and 65.8% in night \nsamples (Najdenovska et al., 2021). A supervised machine learning \nmodel achieved 76% classification accuracy to classify Fe deficiency six \ndays prior to the earliest appearance of symptoms from a normal healthy \nplant (Tran and Camps, 2021). These findings reported accuracies using \nthe GBT classifier. Correspondingly, work on the database considered in \nthis article reported a supervised classification model to early diagnose a \nstrong Fe deficiency with a testing accuracy of 76%. The presented work \nreported a 98.5% classification rate through empirical mode decompo­\nsition and statistical feature extraction. Further, this work can be \nextended to for a multi-class classification considering each nutrient as a \ndifferent class and developing a model to classify mixed classes. \nFurther studies should embrace an extended regimen on nutrient \ndeficiencies and their effect on the growth of plants. Developing \nmethods to understand the electrophysiological signal potential varia­\ntions from nutrient – nutrient specimen and also to differentiate mixed \nnutrient stresses make greater impact on nutrient deficiency detection. \nAlso, modelling different stages of stress to either predict the life span of \nplants or to develop treatment methods based on undergoing deficiency \nor stress circumstances would allow greater precision in crop develop­\nment. Accompanying developments in methods and analyses to assess \nplant status before the appearance of symptoms make a valuable \ncontribution to optimal and restorative crop protection practices. \nDeveloping algorithms for testing the real time data and detect state of \nstress, and type of deficiency crop is undergoing. This would possibly \nenable protecting crops by assisting fertilizer management to farmers in \nfuture. Integration of automated data acquisition, signal analysis, and \nmachine learning in proportion metes out knowledge to better classify \nvarious plant deficiencies during early stages before symptom appear­\nance which makes a drastic change in the agricultural sector to regulate \nplant growth and improve protection methods. \n5. Conclusions \nSignal decomposition and sample selection played a crucial role in \npreparing databases for classification. Present work reported an analysis \nby grouping intrinsic mode functions into 2 groups since four nutrient \ndeficiencies are to be distinguished. Creating a greater number of IMF \ngroups or feature groups may obscure the task. With the assessment of \nfeature matrices obtained and their impact on the classification process, \nthe most relevant samples suitable to distinguish the deficiency state \nfrom the normal state were nominated as set by dimension reduction. \nThis reduction of samples in feature space has a great impact on clas­\nsification performance by reducing model complexity, overfitting ten­\ndency and computational time. The major advantage behind dimension \nreduction is to analyse a greater number of datasets in less duration of \ntime. The seclusion between choosing training and testing datasets from \ndifferent plants improved the neutrality of performance assessment and \nevaluation of each model. Nominating the best features through \nappropriate feature selection methods was not considered in this study \nfor observing feature performance individually. To authorize presented \nconclusions and replicability of performed investigations in nutrient \ndeficiency of tomato plants, the reported work should be studied in \nvarious aspects with different species in different seasons respectively. \nTable 8 \nRelated works reported earlier on plant stress signal analysis.  \nAuthor \nType of Species & \nStimuli \nTD \nFD \nApproach of Signal Analysis \nEstimators/Classifiers \nPerformance Metrics \nChatterjee et al. \n(2014) \n1 bay, 2 cucumber, \n17 Zanzibar plants \nLight by LED \n✓ \n⨯ \nTime-series regression analysis \nLSE, ARX, ARMAX, BJ, OE, \nNLARX, NLHW \nBest prediction obtained by \nNLHW estimators \nDas et al.

This paper proposes a model,\nbased on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) with a conditional generative adversarial\nnetwork (CGAN), which can quickly and effectively identify the salt tolerance of the seedlings using plant\nelectrical signals at the early seedling stage. To address the problem of the small-scale dataset, the improved\nCGAN was used for sample augmentation of plant electrical signals under salt stress. The 1D-CNN can extract\nfeatures efficiently and automatically and distinguish between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive varieties.\nFurthermore, the 1D-CNN was trained using real samples and a training set augmented with generated samples,\nseparately. After data augmentation by the improved CGAN, the accuracy of the CNN increased to 92.31%, and\nthe classification performance was better than that of the traditional method. In conclusion, this method is useful\nand promising for identifying the salt tolerance of plants at the early seedling stage. It is also applicable to other\n1D signals with small-scale datasets, and to other types of crops.\n1. Introduction\nSoil salinization is a serious problem affecting crop growth and\nyield. Breeding crop varieties with salt tolerance is one of the most\nimportant ways to address this problem. Evaluation indicators for the\nsalt tolerance of crops need to be developed, so that the success of\nbreeding can be evaluated. At present, there are two main types of\nindicators: morphological indicators and physiological and biochemical\nindicators (Ibrahim et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2017). Morphological\nindicators can be used to judge the salt tolerance of crops only after\ntheir appearance changes. Therefore, the identification is time-con-\nsuming and laborious. Physiological and biochemical indicators are\nobtained mostly through sampling and experimental measurements,\nand these operations are complex.\nStudies have revealed that plants generate electrical signals when\nthey are stimulated by external stimuli (e.g., salt stress and light). Plant\nelectrical signals carry information on the response to stimuli, and in-\nduce a series of physiological responses and regulatory processes\n(Baluška, 2013; Fromm and Lautner, 2007; Sukhov, 2016; Saraiva\net al., 2017; Vodeneev et al., 2017; Chatterjee et al., 2018; Pereira et al.,\n2018; V. Sukhov et al., 2019; E. Sukhova et al., 2019). These electrical\nresponses are strongly connected with plant tolerance to stressors\n(Sukhov et al., 2017). For example, the work of Sukhov et al. showed\nthat variation potential (an electrical signal induced by damaging sti-\nmuli) increased thermotolerance of photosystem I and contributed to\nheat-related photosystem II damage (Sukhov et al., 2014, 2015; Surova\net al., 2016). In particular, illumination/darkness-induced changes in\nthe leaf surface potential of crop seedlings are able to link plant elec-\ntrical signal data with salt tolerance (Li et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).\nIt is necessary to use machine learning to establish an effective classi-\nfication method for light-induced plant electrical signal data.\nAt present, the analysis of plant electrical signals usually uses\nmodern signal processing or statistical principles to construct features\nartificially. Chatterjee et al. used linear and nonlinear methods to ex-\ntract 11 features from plant electrical signals, and utilized different\nmachine learning algorithms (i.e., Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis,\nquadratic\ndiscriminant\nanalysis,\nnaive\nBayes\nclassifier,\nand\nthe\nMahalonobis classifier) to classify three external stimuli (i.e., NaCl,\nH2SO4, and O3), and the best accuracy was approximately 73.67%\n(Chatterjee et al., 2015). Chen et al. combined a wave-based feature\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.105464\nReceived 26 December 2019; Received in revised form 13 April 2020; Accepted 27 April 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author at: College of Information and Electrical Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China.\nE-mail address: hlan@cau.edu.cn (L. Huang).\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 174 (2020) 105464\nAvailable online 20 May 2020\n0168-1699/ © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nT\nextractor and principal component analysis (PCA), and applied four\nclassifiers (i.e., template matching, back propagation artificial neural\nnetwork, support vector machine, and deep belief networks) to identify\nplant action potential induced by electrical stimulation; a classification\naccuracy of 96% was achieved using a template matching algorithm\n(Chen et al., 2016). However, the light-induced rhythmic bioelec-\ntrogenesis (LIRB) waveform that we recorded was the result of the\ntemporal and spatial superimposition of the multiple cell potential\nchanges of leaves, and has a long duration, which leads to the need for\nautomatic feature extraction.\nWith the emergence of deep learning in recent years, many pro-\nblems in feature engineering, such as feature extraction and transfor-\nmation, have been transformed into representation-learning problems,\nwhich allow a model to be fed with raw data and to automatically\nanalyze and learn targets for classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012;\nLecun et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2016). Deep learning, particularly\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied successfully\nto feature extraction from bioelectrical activities and the identification\nof abnormal heartbeat (Nguyen et al., 2018; Pourbabaee et al., 2018),\nand the results are better than those of traditional feature extraction\nmethods. In contrast with CNNs, traditional machine learning methods\nusually rely on hand-designed features (Lecun et al., 2015; Ng, 2018).\nTherefore, with existing methods of time and frequency domain feature\nextraction, and commonly used statistics, it is difficult to extract\nabundant features automatically (Li et al., 2018). The generation and\npropagation of plant electrical signals are based on the cellular net-\nwork, through symplasts and apoplasts among multiple types of cells\n(de Toledo et al., 2019); this mechanism provides a basis for con-\nstructing data-driven models for extraction and classification of plant\nelectrical signal features. In this work, we designed an improved CNN\nnetwork structure suitable for the classification of light-induced plant\nelectrical signals under salt stress.\nAlthough deep learning reduces dependence on prior knowledge\nand allows features to be learnt automatically from raw data (Lecun\net al., 2015), it is necessary to acquire representative data, to reduce\noverfitting and improve model generalization (Srivastava et al., 2014).\nHowever, it may be difficult to obtain a large number of samples, be-\ncause of the rarity of plant samples used for breeding screening and the\nlack of a high-throughput measurement method for recording electrical\nsignals from many different plants. On the one hand, deep learning\nmodels are more attractive than traditional approaches. On the other\nhand, a large amount of data is needed to train the deep neural net-\nworks. Therefore, it is challenging to construct a stable model with a\nsmall-scale dataset to classify plant electrical signals for the salt toler-\nance of wheat seedlings.\nVirtual sample generation technology is one of the most effective\nmethods to cope with the problem of small-scale samples. The gen-\nerative adversarial network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) can be\nused to generate virtual samples. It is not necessary to assume a data\nprobability distribution, and full use can be made of existing data to\ngenerate virtual samples that follow the original sample probability\ndistribution. Accordingly, the GAN has been widely used in the field of\nimage and speech generation and has achieved impressive results\n(Ledig et al., 2017; Pascual et al., 2017; Nojavanasghari et al., 2018;\nDouarre et al., 2019; Nazki et al., 2019). Compared with other data\naugmentation methods—such as noise addition, interpolation, hidden\nMarkov model, autoencoder, and variational autoencoders—the GAN\nhas better performance. The advantages of the GAN have inspired us to\nexplore its application in the field of plant electrical signals. To our\nknowledge, there is no published research on generating plant electrical\nsignals using a GAN. In this paper, an improved GAN is proposed to\ngenerate virtual samples, to solve the problem of the relatively small\namount of plant electrical signal data, and then to improve the per-\nformance of feature extraction and classification models.\nMoreover, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of one-dimensional\n(1D) generated data, such as plant electrical signals. To our knowledge,\naccording to the related literature (Hartmann et al., 2018; Luo and Lu,\n2018; Aznan et al., 2019), there is no single performance index that can\nevaluate the quality of the generated samples in sufficient detail, but\nthe combination of several indexes with different advantages can better\nevaluate the similarity between the generated samples and the real\nsamples.\nIt is well known that the convolution kernel of a CNN is very im-\nportant. In speech recognition, feature extraction from speech signals\ncan be implemented well using 1D convolution. However, the fre-\nquency range of speech signals ranges from 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz, whereas\nthe frequency range of plant electrical signals ranges from approxi-\nmately 0.03 Hz to 15 Hz (Stolarz et al., 2010; Cabral et al., 2011;\nMousavi et al., 2013; Souza et al., 2017; Sukhov et al., 2017; Pereira\net al., 2018; V. Sukhov et al., 2019), which is much lower. Therefore,\nexisting models from speech recognition cannot be applied directly to\nthe feature extraction of plant electrical signals. Because the two types\nof signals have different frequencies, and the physical meaning of the\nconvolution kernel is a filter (Socher et al., 2012; Lecun et al., 2015),\nwe had to completely redesign the 1D convolution kernel and the\nnetwork structure of the CNN, to make them suitable for plant electrical\nsignals.\nIn summary, the main contributions of the paper are as follows:\n(1) A model was proposed, based on an improved CNN, for extraction\nand classification of plant electrical signal features, and applied to\nthe salt tolerance of wheat seedlings.\n(2) To construct a more stable classification model, the improved GAN\nwas used to augment the data and enrich the dataset. Based on the\nconditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), the network\nstructures of the generator and discriminator were designed to\nimprove the performance of the classification model.\n(3) Several indicators were developed to evaluate the quality of the\ngenerated samples and the performance of the generative model. In\naddition, the validity of the generated data was verified by training\nthe classifier with generated data.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the\ndataset and proposed methods of data augmentation, feature extrac-\ntion, and classification. Section 3 presents the results of this study,\nwhich are then discussed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Data acquisition\nTwo varieties of wheat seedlings were used in this study. Seeds of\nthe salt-tolerant wheat ‘Dekang961’ (DK961) and salt-sensitive durum\nwheat ‘Langdon’ (LD) were obtained from the College of Agronomy and\nBiotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing (Huang et al.,\n2006; Zheng et al., 2012). The wheat seedlings were incubated under a\nphotoperiod of 14 h/10 h (light/dark) at 28/26 °C and a relative hu-\nmidity of 60% for 4–5 days. Uniform seedlings 9 cm in height were\nmoved to the measurement chamber to record LIRB. The protocol for\ndata acquisition was defined by Wang et al. (2019). The recording\nelectrode in the lid of the measurement chamber was connected to the\ninput of a high-resistance amplifier (SWF-1B, Chengdu Instrument\nFactory, Chengdu, China). The reference electrode in the bottom of the\nchamber was connected to the ground of the amplifier. The output of\nthe high-impedance amplifier was connected to the input of a physio-\nlogical signal acquisition system (RM6240BD, Chengdu Instrument\nFactory, China). The signal was recorded using the DC coupling method\nand plotted using the RM6240 acquisition software (Zhao et al., 2013).\nAll measurements of LIRB were taken inside a light-tight Faraday cage.\nStimulation with a cycle of 10 min light and 10 min darkness was used\nto induce electrical potential change in the leaf tip. For salt stimulation\nof the leaf of the wheat seedlings, salt-supplemented solid conductive\nX.-H. Qin, et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 174 (2020) 105464\n2\nagarose gel (300 mM NaCl, 0.5% agar, 5 mM KCl) was used. The liquid-\nstate salt-supplemented conductive agarose gel was poured onto the\nlower surface of lids to which Ag/AgCl electrodes had been fixed. These\nsalt stimulation lids could be used once the agarose gel had cooled,\nsolidified, and was tightly coupled to the lower surface of the lid. For\neach sample, data were gathered continuously from approximately\n1.5 h before until 4 h after application of the salt stimulation in the\nsame seedling. In this study, we reduced the sampling rate and recorded\na data point every 6 s. More detailed information on the experimental\nsetup can be found in Wang et al. (2019).\n2.2. Dataset\nWe used 127 wheat seedlings (i.e., 70 DK961 and 57 LD) to acquire\n127 sets of LIRB data to form a raw dataset. To test the discrimination\nability of the classifier, the raw dataset was randomly divided into a\ntraining set DS1 (101 samples) and a test set DS2 (26 samples) at a ratio\nof 8:2. That is, most of the samples were used as the training set, to train\nthe model, and a small number of samples were left as the test set, to\ntest the accuracy of the trained model. To avoid introducing un-\nnecessary extra bias in the process of data division, and affecting the\nfinal result, the sample sizes of DK961 and LD should be balanced in\nboth the training set and test set. We used a stratified sampling method:\n80% of the samples were randomly selected from each variety and were\npooled together to form the training set. In addition, the real training\nset and 200 samples generated by the CGAN were merged into another\nnew training set DS3 (301 samples).\n2.3. The general framework of the proposed method\nFig. 1 shows the overall process, including the data preprocessing,\ndata augmentation, feature extraction, and classification.\nAll the data were preprocessed by extracting the signal from the raw\ndata, removing the baseline, and normalizing; the details of this part are\ndescribed in Section 2.4. The improved CNN was developed to extract\nfeatures, and a SoftMax layer was used for classification. Furthermore,\nthe improved CGAN was used to generate high-quality samples with the\nsame distribution as the real samples, to augment the data and enrich\nthe training set, so as to improve the performance of the feature ex-\ntraction and classification models.\n2.4. Data preprocessing\nAs shown in Fig. 2 the electrical potential change in every period\nshowed strong repeatability, but the wheat seedlings required ap-\nproximately two or three light–dark cycles to reach a steady regular\nwaveform. Therefore, in the following analysis, we used the extracted\nLIRB data that were recorded after the third light–dark cycle. For each\nitem of LIRB data, three waveforms were extracted and combined to-\ngether as a piece of data: the latest complete periodic waveform before\nsalt stimulation, the first periodic waveform during salt stimulation,\nand the seventh periodic waveform during salt stimulation (namely the\na, b, and c waveform periods shown in the green dotted boxes of Fig. 2).\nEach waveform contained 196 data points, and the combined waveform\ncontained 588 data points.\nFor comparability purposes, the baseline value (namely the starting-\npoint value of wave a) was subtracted from the three waveforms ex-\ntracted from each item of raw data.\nTo accelerate the convergence of the model and convert the wave-\nform to the same range as the output of the GAN, we normalized the\ndataset to [−1,1] by Eq. (1).\n=\n×\n=\n=\nY\nX\nX\nX\nX\ni\nn j\nm\n2\n1(\n1, 2,\n, ;\n1, 2,\n,\n)\ni\ni j\nj min\nj max\nj min\n,\n,\n,\n,\n(1)\nwhere Xi,j is the j-th feature of the i-th sample, Xj,max is the maximum of\nthe j-th feature, Xj,min is the minimum of the j-th feature, n is the\nnumber of samples, and m is the feature dimension.\n2.5. Data augmentation\nTo overcome the challenge of the small-scale dataset, a generation\nmethod based on a CGAN (Mizra and Osindero, 2014) was proposed, to\nimprove the accuracy, generalization, and robustness of the classifica-\ntion model of plant electrical signals under salt stress. Fig. 3 shows the\noverall framework, which includes two parts: the data generation based\non the CGAN, and the evaluation and application of the generated data.\nIn contrast to unsupervised learning, the CGAN introduces category\ninformation to generate labeled synthetic samples. This mechanism\ncontributes to model convergence and avoids mode collapse.\n2.5.1. Data generation based on GAN\nA GAN consists of two different networks: a generative model,\ncalled a generator (G), and a discriminative model, called a dis-\ncriminator (D). They are trained in an adversarial manner. Specifically,\nthe generator takes a random noise vector z and a class label C as input,\nand tries to confuse the discriminator by generating fake samples G(z|C)\nwith high quality. The real data and the data generated by the generator\nare input to the discriminator, which then learns to distinguish whether\na given sample is real. In this adversarial game, both models attempt to\nobtain optimized results: the generator can generate virtual samples\nwhose distribution is the most similar to the real data, and the dis-\ncriminator can achieve high classification accuracy. The overall value\nfunction is:\n=\n+\nV D G\nE\nlogD x C\nE\nD G z C\nmin max\n( ,\n)\n~\n[\n( | )]\n~\n[log(1\n(\n( | )))]\nG\nD\nx\nP\nZ\nP\ndata x\nZ z\n( )\n( )\n(2)\nwhere x is the real plant electrical signal data, z is the noise vector input\nto G, Pdata(x) is the real data distribution, Pz(z) is the generated data\ndistribution, D(x|C) represents the probability that D judges that the\nreal plant electrical signal data of class C is true, and D(G(z|C)) re-\npresents the probability that D judges that the virtual sample of class C,\nFig. 1. Overall flow of the proposed method.\nX.-H. Qin, et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 174 (2020) 105464\n3\ngenerated by G, is true.\nIn this work, we designed an improved network structure for the\ngenerator and discriminator of the GAN model, to generate virtual\nsamples of plant electrical signals, cycle by cycle.\nIn the generator, the input layer merged the noise and the class\nlabel, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The random noise was sampled from a\nuniform distribution U[−1,1], and the latent dimension was 100. The\nnetwork contained three fully connected hidden layers, with 128, 256,\nand 512 neurons, respectively, and one output layer with 196 neurons,\nusing tanh as activation function. Each hidden layer was followed by a\nbatch normalization layer with momentum 0.8.\nThe discriminator contained four fully connected hidden layers with\n512 neurons, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The dropout and a Leaky-ReLU\nactivation function, where the slope of the leak was set to 0.2, were\napplied between each layer. The key idea of the dropout mechanism is\nto drop units randomly, with a certain probability, from the neural\nnetwork during training. This reduces overfitting significantly, and\nimproves the robustness of the neural network. If the dropout rate (i.e.,\nthe probability of retaining a unit) is too small, the model training is\nunbalanced; if the dropout rate is too large, the convergence rate of the\nFig. 2.

Waves a, b, and c in the green dotted boxes were extracted from the complete LIRB data for feature extraction and classi-\nfication. Wave a is the last complete light–dark cycle wave before continuous salt stimulation. Wave b is the first complete light–dark cycle wave during the salt stress\nperiod. Wave c is the seventh light–dark cycle wave during the salt stress period.

Finally, two label prediction layers were added as the output\nlayers: the sigmoid function was used to predict the sample source, and\nthe softmax function was used to predict the class label of the sample.\nThe networks were optimized by an Adam optimizer, and the\nparameters were set as follows: the learning rate was 0.0001, beta_1/\nbeta_2 was 0.5, and batch_size was 16.\n2.5.2. Performance evaluation of GAN\nThe main goal of the GAN is to generate artificial data samples to\nenrich the dataset and improve the performance of the classification\nmodel. To evaluate the performance of the generative model, we de-\nveloped a set of indicators to evaluate the quality of generated samples,\nas shown in Table 1. Finally, the generated samples were used to train\nthe classifier to verify the effectiveness of the generated samples in the\nclassification of the plant electrical signals for the salt tolerance of\nwheat seedlings.\nDeviation index (DI) represents the distance between two samples.\nPearson correlation coefficient (PCC) measures the linear correlation\nbetween the two samples from a statistical perspective, with a value\nabove 0.8 indicating a strong correlation, following (Benesty et al.,\n2009). The larger the absolute value of the PCC, the stronger the re-\nlationship.\n·Deviation index:\n=\n=\nx\nµ\nn\nDI\n(\n)\ni\nn\ni\ni\n1\n2\n(3)\nwhere x is one sample, μ represents the center vector (template sample),\nand n is the number of points within each sample.\n·Pearson correlation coefficient:\n=\n=\n=\n=\nx\nx\nµ\nµ\nx\nx\nµ\nµ\nPCC\n(\n¯)(\n¯)\n(\n¯)\n(\n¯)\ni\nn\ni\ni\ni\nn\ni\ni\nn\ni\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n(4)\nwhere x is one sample, μ represents the center vector,\n=\n=\nx\nx\n¯\nn\ni\nn\ni\n1\n1\n,\n=\n=\nµ\nµ\n¯\nn\ni\nn\ni\n1\n1\n, and n is the number of points within each sample.\nFor each indicator, the center vectors u1 and u2, of DK961 and LD,\nrespectively were calculated as the arithmetic mean of all samples.

Each indicator was then calculated be-\ntween each generated sample and the center vector, and the average\nvalue of each indicator was taken as the generated-sample indicator\n(GI). Finally, the RIs were compared with the GIs: a small difference\nbetween the RIs and GIs represents a high similarity.\n2.6. Feature extraction and classification\n2.6.1. Convolutional neural network\nWhen faced with a dataset without prior knowledge, it may be\ndifficult to construct features using traditional feature engineering, but\nit is possible to learn features automatically using deep learning. For\nthis reason, we used a CNN to extract the electrical signal features of\ncrop seedlings automatically.\nThe core building block of a CNN is the convolutional layer, which\nperforms a convolution operation between filters and local regions of\nthe input. The initial convolutional layer is responsible for extracting\nlow-level features, such as the sudden changes of a signal; while the\ndeeper convolutional layers can extract more abstract high-level fea-\ntures related to salt tolerance.\nGenerally, CNNs are mostly used for two-dimensional data, such as\nimages. To use a CNN for processing the 1D plant electrical signals data,\nwe redesigned the convolutional kernels. The network structure of the\nimproved CNN is shown in Fig. 5. Each convolutional layer had 16\nfilters with batch normalization (momentum = 0.8) and ReLU as the\nactivation function, and the kernel size was k × 1. Except for the last\nconvolutional layer, each convolutional layer was followed by a Max\nPooling layer. The last convolutional layer was flattened and then\nlinked to three fully connected layers. The network was trained using\nthe stochastic gradient descent optimizer with learning rate lr = 0.008,\ndecay = 1e−7, momentum = 0.5, and epoch = 300.\nThe details of the network structure are shown in Table 2.\n2.6.2. SoftMax classification\nA SoftMax layer was used for classification after the last fully con-\nnected layer of the CNN. SoftMax converts an n-dimensional arbitrary\nreal vector to an n-dimensional vector that satisfies the following two\nconditions.\nTable 1\nEvaluation indicators of generated samples.\nEvaluation indicator\nEvaluation content\nDeviation index (DI)\nThe similarity between the sample and the center vector (template sample), as a function of Euclidean distance.\nPearson correlation coefficient (PCC)\nThe linear correlation between the sample and the center vector.\nFig. 5.

The elements of the vector add up to 1.\nThis ensures that the sum of all the output neurons is 1, and the\nvalue of each output, in the interval [0,1], is the probability of the\noutput; the output with the maximum probability is taken as the final\nprediction.\nTherefore, the multi-classification problem can be solved with\nprobabilities. The calculation formula is as follows:\n=\nx\ne\ne\nSoftMax( )\ni\nx\nj\nx\ni\nj\n(5)\nwhere xi represents the i-th element in vector x.\n2.6.3. Evaluation indicators for classification model\nTo evaluate the performance of the classification model, we selected\nthe following indicators.\n·Accuracy (ACC) is the ratio of the number of correctly classified\nsamples to the total number of samples.\n=\n+\n+\n+\n+\nTP\nTN\nTP\nTN\nFP\nFN\nACC\n(\n)\n(6)\nwhere TP, TN, FP, and FN denote the numbers of true positives, true\nnegatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.\nSensitivity (SEN) is the proportion of correctly classified positive\nsamples among all positive samples; this measures the ability of the\nclassifier to recognize positive samples.\n=\n+\nTP\nTP\nFN\nSEN\n(7)\nSpecificity (SPE) is the proportion of correctly classified negative\nsamples among all negative samples this measures the ability of the\nclassifier to recognize negative samples.\n=\n+\nTN\nFP\nTN\nSPE\n(8)\nReceiver operating characteristics curve (ROC curve): A curve\ndrawn with the false positive rate (FPR) as the horizontal axis and the\ntrue positive rate (TPR) as the vertical axis; this measures the stability\nof the model.

Results\n3.1. Data augmentation\nThe real training set (DS1) was used to train the CGAN. The in-\ndicators presented in Section 2.5.2 were used to evaluate the similarity\nbetween the generated samples and the real samples; the results are\nshown in Table 3.\nAs shown in Table 3, the differences between RIs and GIs were\nsmall, indicating that the generated data were similar to the real data.\nThe PCC values of LD were all greater than 0.8, indicating that the\ngenerated data and the real data had a strong correlation. However, the\nPCC value of the generated DK961 samples was 0.68, which was much\nlower than that of the real DK961 samples. Fig. 6 shows a scatter plot of\nthe PCC values of DK961. Fig. 6(a) shows that only a few real DK961\nsamples were dissimilar to the template sample (PCC < 0.8), but the\nCGAN can learn to generate these samples. In this experiment, the\nrandomly selected generated set of samples contains a larger number of\ndissimilar samples, as shown in Fig. 6(b). As a result, the average PCC\nvalue of the synthetic DK961 samples was low.\n3.2. Feature extraction and classification\nWe selected 100 samples of DK961 and 100 samples of LD from the\ngenerated set of samples and added them to the training set DS1, to\nexpand the training set to DS3 (a total of 301 samples), which was\nprepared for the subsequent training of the classification models.\nThe usage of the training set and test set of each model in this\nsection is shown in Table 4.\nAs a baseline method, we adopted PCA for dimension reduction and\nfeature extraction, and used Gaussian naive Bayes to classify salt tol-\nerance (Wang et al., 2019). The classification results, with different\nnumbers of principal components, are shown in Table 5. The classifi-\ncation performance was best when six principal components were re-\ntained. The principal component variance accounted for 98.64%.\nThe classification results using our proposed CNN model, trained by\nDS1 and DS3, are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 6. Fig. 7 shows that, when\nthe CGAN was used for data augmentation, the overfitting of the clas-\nsifier had been reduced, and the accuracy increased from 80.77% to\n92.31%.\nTable 6 shows that all the performance indicators of the classifica-\ntion model were improved using the CNN with data augmentation,\ncompared with the baseline model or the CNN without data augmen-\ntation. Because the baseline (PCA + Bayes) and CNN models both\nmisclassified 3 DK961 and 2 LD samples, the results of rows 1 and 2 in\nTable 6 (calculated according to Eqs. (6)–(8)) are exactly the same.\nHowever, the specific samples that were misclassified by the two\nmodels were different. It is also a coincidence that the three indicators\nhave exactly the same value for CNN + CGAN. This is because the\nnumber of DK961 and LD samples in the test set is the same, and the\nnumber of misclassifications of the DK961 and LD samples is also the\nsame.\nThe ROC curves and AUC values of the three models are shown in\nFig. 8. The ROC curve with data augmentation (pink line) completely\nsurrounded the ROC curve without data augmentation (orange line);\nthis indicates that the performance of the CNN classifiers improved\nafter the virtual samples generated by the CGAN were added to the\ntraining set. Although the ROC curve of CNN + CGAN (pink line) in-\ntersects the ROC curve of PCA + Bayes (green line), the AUC value of\nCNN\n+\nCGAN\nis\n0.93,\nwhich\nis\nslightly\nlarger\nthan\nthat\nof\nPCA + Bayes.\n4. Discussion\nElectrical potential changes in plants are associated with the ionic\ndynamics of cell membranes (Shabala, 1997; Fromm and Lautner, 2007;\nTable 3\nQuality evaluation of generated samples.\nType\nPCC\nDI\nDK961\nRI\n0.93\n29.73\nGI\n0.68\n56.96\nLD\nRI\n0.99\n20.96\nGI\n0.98\n14.07\nX.-H. Qin, et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 174 (2020) 105464\n7\nSukhov et al., 2019), and different salt-tolerant varieties have their own\ncomplex ionic mechanism (Wu et al., 2014; Stolarz and Dziubinska,\n2017; Kisnieriene et al., 2019), which is the biological basis of our re-\nsearch that can classify different salt-tolerant varieties using plant\nelectrical signals.\nThe improved CNN, combined with the improved CGAN proposed\nin this paper, was used to classify the plant electrical signal data for salt\ntolerance of wheats at the seedling stage. The results show that the\nmodel can extract features and identify salt tolerance, with ACC, SPE,\nand SEN all reaching 92.31%. The method is faster than observing the\nmorphological characteristics of plants, and it may facilitate screening\nsalt-tolerant varieties of crops at an early seedling stage.\n4.1. Factors affecting CGAN for sample augmentation\nAlthough the results show that using the CGAN to augment samples\ncan help in constructing a reliable classification model, under the\ncondition of small-scale samples, some basic factors that affect sample\ngeneration should be considered in practice. These factors include data\nnormalization, noise evaluation of generated data, and selection of the\nnumber of real samples required for CGAN training.\nFor the CGAN model, the output range of the activation function\ntanh, of the last output layer of the CGAN, is [−1,1]. Therefore, the\ninput range of the CGAN must be consistent with it: that is, the original\ndata should be normalized to the range [−1,1]. There are two types of\nnormalization methods for a 1D signal: one is to normalize each signal\nitself (sample-level), and the other is to normalize each dimensional\nfeature of all samples (feature-level). When the former was used to\nnormalize the input of the CGAN, the plant electrical signals could not\nbe classified correctly by the CNN, and the classification accuracy was\nonly 61.54%. Therefore, the second normalization method was used in\nthis study. The feature-level normalized data of the entire set of samples\nwas used as the input of the improved CGAN, and the generated virtual\nsamples were the normalized plant electrical signals.\nIn addition, as shown in Fig. 9(a), the generated samples contained\nhigh-frequency noise. To reduce noise, we improved the network\nstructure of the generator of the CGAN by reducing the number of\nhidden layers and increasing the number of neurons. At the same time,\nas shown in Fig. 9(b), we found that generating plant electrical signals\nfor three cycles of the combined waveform at a time introduced more\nnoise than generating data for only one cycle—in this example, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a single cycle was 33.54, and the SNR of\nthe generated combined waveform was 28.20.\nTherefore, we made the following two improvements. First, under\nthe premise of not losing too much information, the data was down-\nsampled to reduce the length of the time series. Second, the virtual\nsamples were generated, cycle by cycle, and then connected. With these\nmethods, the CGAN can learn the signal features better and generate\nvirtual samples with better shape.\nWhen training the CGAN model, we used the stratified sampling\nmethod to select 80% of the real samples (DK961: 57 samples, LD: 44\nsamples) as the training set. To estimate the sample size required for the\nstudy, we used statistical methods for simple verification: first, we used\nthe wrapped feature selection method, to select the most effective\nfeatures from 16 high-level features extracted from the CNN; second,\nfollowing (Zhou et al., 2011), the sample size of each feature was es-\ntimated separately, and the largest sample size was selected as the\nsample size of this study (DK961: 51 samples, LD: 41 samples). The\nresult was almost identical to the size of the training set in this study.\nHowever, there remain some problems with the CGAN training that\nneed to be addressed. High-frequency noise still exists in some virtual\nsamples generated by the CGAN. When the shape of the generated\nsample is similar to that of the template sample, the noise is small.\nWhen the generated time series is too long, the noise in the generated\nsample increases. In the future, we need to explore more suitable CGAN\nmodel network structures with digital filters. Moreover, we observed\nthat the ratio of generated data to real data should also be considered as\na hyperparameter to be adjusted. In this study, when 100 generated\nsamples of each variety of wheat were added to the training set, the\nperformance of the classifier was optimal. In addition, how to measure\nthe similarity of time series, to quantitatively evaluate the quality of\nsamples generated by the GAN, is another topic worth addressing in\nfuture work.\nIn addition, there are numerous physiologically significant mathe-\nmatical models of plant electrical signals (Sukhova et al., 2017). These\nFig. 6. PCC values of DK961. (a) The PCC values of the real DK961 samples; (b) the PCC values of the generated DK961 samples.

Sample augmentation helps 1D-CNN to identify light-induced plant\nelectrical signals under salt stress\nAt present, CNNs and GANs are mostly used in the field of two-\ndimensional image processing. There is no research using a 1D-CNN to\nclassify plant electrical signals for the salt tolerance of wheat seedlings\nor using a GAN to generate virtual samples of plant electrical signals. In\nthis study, these two algorithms were combined and improved for the\nfirst time, to classify plant electrical signals for the salt tolerance of\nwheat seedlings, and better performance than existing methods was\nachieved.\nIn previous studies that used CNNs to process 1D signals, the 1D\nFig. 7.

Qin, et al.\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 174 (2020) 105464\n9\nsignals were generally encoded into images, and then two-dimensional\nCNNs were used for feature extraction and classification (Isin and\nOzdalili, 2017; Xia et al., 2018). This increases the amount of compu-\ntation, and features extracted from the stacked images are difficult to\ninterpret. In this study, we designed a 1D convolutional kernel that\ndirectly used 1D plant electrical signals as input. It does not need to\nperform two-dimensional conversion of the original signals, which re-\nduces the workload of signal preprocessing. Moreover, the 1D-CNN is\neasier to train and implement. In addition, when a sufficiently robust\nand accurate model is constructed, the extracted features have low\ninter-class similarity and high intra-class similarity.\nAfter adding the virtual samples generated by the CGAN to the\ntraining set, the classification accuracy increased from 80.77% to\n92.31%, which validates the effectiveness of the generated samples\nindirectly. We assume that, although the quality of virtual samples\ngenerated by the CGAN is not optimal, the generated samples introduce\na certain amount of noise into the classification model, which produces\na regularization effect and improves the model performance.\nWe used PCA and Bayes classification algorithms as a baseline\nmethod. The classification accuracy of the baseline method was\n80.77%, which was the same as that of the CNN before data augmen-\ntation. When the amount of data is small, the performance of the neural\nnetwork is similar to the traditional classification method. However,\nwhen the amount of data increases substantially, the performance of the\nnaive Bayes classification method may not be significantly improved,\nand the deep learning CNN has more potential.\nCNN training can easily result in overfitting because of the small\nsample size. From the algorithm perspective, multi-task learning tech-\nnology can be considered in the future, to train the CNN and GAN to-\ngether and share the weights, and the noise introduced by the GAN can\nreduce the overfitting of the CNN. The integrated classifier can also be\nused for system fusion, to further improve the performance of the\nclassification model.\nIn the future, it is still necessary to conduct experiments to collect\ndata and add more varieties of wheat, which can increase the number of\nreal samples, enrich the dataset, and further improve the generalization\nof the model. Finally, the online computing function of the above al-\ngorithms will be deployed on the PlantES platform (Song et al., 2018)\ndeveloped by our research group, to implement data and tool sharing.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we propose a model to classify plant electrical signals\nfor the salt tolerance of wheat seedlings. The 1D-CNN with the CGAN\ncan extract features effectively and classify them on a relatively small\ntraining set. Compared with traditional methods, the improved 1D-CNN\ncan realize automatic feature extraction, and classification accuracy\nreached 80.77%. Furthermore, the CGAN was used to generate high-\nquality virtual samples to enrich the dataset, which mitigated the\noverfitting phenomenon and improved the performance of the classi-\nfication model, whose classification accuracy was up to 92.31%. Our\nmethod is a potentially useful tool for effectively identifying salt tol-\nerance at the early stage of crops, for research on resistance breeding.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nXiao-Huang\nQin:\nConceptualization,\nMethodology,\nSoftware,\nValidation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Visualization,\nWriting - original draft, Writing - review & editing.
